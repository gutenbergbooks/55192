Bill conical, the outlines slightly curved; the lower mandible decidedly
larger than the upper; the commissure
gently sinuated; the roof of the mouth
not knobbed. Feet slender; tarsus
rather longer than the middle toe; the
hinder toe a little longer than the outer
lateral, which slightly exceeds the
inner; the outer claw reaching the base
of the middle one, and half as long
as its toe. Claws moderately curved.
Tertiaries and secondaries nearly equal;
wing somewhat pointed, reaching not
quite to the middle of the tail. First
quill a little shorter than the second and
equal to the fifth; third longest. Tail
rather long, moderately forked, and divaricated at the tip; the feathers rather narrow.
Back streaked; rump and beneath immaculate. Young streaked beneath.</p>

<p>This genus differs from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zonotrichia</i> principally in the smaller size and
longer and forked, instead of rounded tail.</p>

<p>Birds of the year of this genus are very difficult to distinguish, even by
size, except in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">monticola</i>. The more immature birds are also very closely

Middle of back with the feathers dark brown centrally, then rufous, and
edged with pale fulvous (sometimes with whitish).
Hood and upper part of nape continuous
chestnut; a line of the same from behind the
eye, as well as a short maxillary stripe. Sides
of head and neck ashy. A broad light superciliary
band. Beneath whitish, tinged with fulvous;
the throat with ashy; a small circular
blotch of brownish in the middle of the upper
part of the breast; the sides chestnut. Edges of
tail-feathers, primary quills, and two bands across
the tips of the secondaries, white. Tertiaries
nearly black; edged externally with rufous, turning
to white near the tips. Lower jaw yellow;
upper black. Young bird streaked on throat
and breast, as well as on crown. Length, 6.25
inches; wing, 3.00.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Eastern North America to the Missouri, north to Arctic Ocean; also on Pole
Creek and Little Colorado River, New Mexico; Western Nevada.</p>

<p>This species varies in the amount of whitish edging to the quills and
tail.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Essentially a northern bird, the Tree Sparrow breeds in high
Arctic regions, only appearing in winter within the United States. It is then
common as far south as Pennsylvania. A few winter in South Carolina.</p>

<p>It arrives on the Saskatchewan in the latter part of April, where it only
<!--012.png--><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>
makes a short halt, proceeding farther north to breed. Bischoff obtained a
specimen at Sitka. Mr. Kennicott found its nest and eggs on the Yukon,
and Mr. Dall obtained it at Nulato, and more sparingly below that point.
Mr. MacFarlane met with it breeding in large numbers at Fort Anderson.
The nests were in various situations, the larger proportion on the ground, a
few in bushes near the ground, and only one is mentioned as having been
several feet above it. One was in the cleft of a low willow on the edge of
a small lake; another, in a bush, was nearly four feet from the ground; and
a third was in a clump of willows and fourteen inches above the ground.
Nearly all the other nests mentioned were built directly upon the ground.</p>

<p>The nests were constructed of dry bark and grasses, loosely put together,
and very warmly lined with feathers. On the ground they were usually
concealed in a tuft of grass. In all instances the female alone was found
on the nests, the male being very rarely seen in their vicinity. The usual
number of eggs in a nest was four or five, occasionally six, and even seven.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley obtained a single specimen at Fort Dalles, and Dr. Cooper
saw a flock in September, 1863, and again in 1864 at the mouth of the
Columbia. Lieutenant Bryan met with them among the Rocky Mountains
in latitude 39<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, in August. Mr. Ridgway found them very common during
the winter in the interior.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found this Sparrow common in all the wooded districts of Labrador.
It was very tame and unsuspicious, showing no fear even when closely
approached. I have never met with any, in summer, in any part of New
Brunswick or Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>This Sparrow is occasionally abundant in Massachusetts early in October,
but rarely appears in full numbers until November. Some remain in the
gardens in and about Boston during the winter, and during November the
marshes of Fresh Pond are filled with them, when their wailing autumnal
chant is in marked contrast with the sweet and sprightly song with which
they enliven the spring, just before they are about to depart for their summer
homes. They remain until the latter part of April, and Mr. Allen has
observed them at Springfield till about the first of May.</p>

<p>In regard to their song, Mr. William Brewster informs me that they usually
commence singing about the 25th of March. Their song is a loud, clear,
and powerful chant, starting with two high notes, then falling rapidly, and
ending with a low, sweet warble. He has heard a few singing with their
full vigor in November and December, but this is rare.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found them not common in South Carolina, but Dr. Kennerly
states that they were quite abundant in December on the Little Colorado, in
New Mexico, feeding on the fruit of the wild grape and upon seeds.</p>

<p>During the love-season the Tree Sparrow is quite a fine musician, its
song resembling that of the Canary, but finer, sweeter, and not so loud. In
their migrations, Mr. Audubon states, a flock of twenty or more will perch
upon the same tree, and join in a delightful chorus. Their flight is elevated
<!--013.png--><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>
and graceful, and in waving undulations. On opening the stomachs of
those he shot at the Magdeleine Islands, Mr. Audubon found them containing
minute shell-fish, coleopterous insects, hard seeds, berries, and grains of
sand.</p>

<p>Nests obtained near Fort Anderson confirm the descriptions given by Mr.
Hutchins, as observed in the settlement at Hudson’s Bay. The eggs, which
are much larger than those of the other species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spizella</i>, measure .85 by
.65 of an inch. Their ground-color is a light green, over which the eggs are
very generally freckled with minute markings of a foxy brown. These
markings are distributed with great regularity, but so sparsely as to leave
the ground distinctly visible.</p>

Eastern North America to the Missouri River; San Antonio, Texas in winter

<p>This species is about the size of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. socialis</i>, but is more rufous above;
lacks the black forehead and eye stripe; has chestnut ears, instead of ash;
has the bill red, instead of black; lacks the clear ash of the rump; has a
longer tail, etc. It is more like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">monticola</i>, but is much smaller; lacks the
spot on the breast, and the predominance of white on the wings, etc. The
young have the breast and sides streaked, and the crown slightly so.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Field Sparrow occupies a well-defined and somewhat
compact area, being resident within the United States, and in its migrations
not removing far from its summer abode. In the summer it breeds
from Virginia to Maine, as far as the central and western portions. It is
not found near Calais, but occurs and breeds near Norway, Oxford County.
In the interior it is found still farther north, in Canada, Iowa, and Wisconsin,
to the Red River settlements, where it was found breeding by Donald
Gunn. At Hamilton, Ontario, Mr. McIlwraith states it to be a rather rare
<!--014.png--><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span>
summer resident. It breeds in Southern Wisconsin and in Iowa, but is not
abundant. It does not appear to have been found west of the Missouri
Valley.</p>

<p>This Sparrow arrives in Massachusetts early in April, and is found almost
exclusively in open pastures, old fields, and in clearings remote from villages.
It is a shy, retiring bird, and seems to avoid the near presence of man. Wilson
states that it has no song, nothing but a kind of chirruping, not much
superior to the chirping of a cricket. But this is quite a mistake, as it is
in reality a very varied and fine singer. Its notes are not very powerful,
and cannot be heard any distance, but they are very pleasing, although
little known or appreciated. It continues in full song until into July, when
the second brood is about hatching, when its notes relax, but do not cease
until just before its departure in September or early October.</p>

<p>Mr. D. D. Hughes, of Grand Rapids, <abbr title="Michigan">Mich.</abbr>, in an interesting paper on the
habits of this species, speaks of its beautiful tinkling song as one of its most
marked features. To his ear it resembles the ringing of a tiny bell more
nearly than anything else. In the early morning and at evening the fields
ring with their plaintive and tender peals. It sings at all hours of the day,
during the nesting-season, even in the noonday heat of summer, when most
other birds are silent.</p>

<p>In Virginia these birds may be found throughout the year, though probably
not the same birds in the same localities, some retiring farther south and
others coming to take their places from the north. In winter they are found,
in the greatest abundance in South Carolina and Georgia, occurring in large
loose flocks, found chiefly along the roadsides and in old fields and pastures
in the rural districts.</p>

<p>The Field Sparrow nests both on the ground and in low bushes, or among
tangled clusters of vines. I have found their nests in all these situations,
and have no doubt the nature of the surface may have something to do with
the position. In high dry pastures, in sheltered situations, I have always
found their nests on the ground. In the wet meadows and fields subject to
a rise of water, as about the Potomac, near Washington, where these birds
are very abundant, they almost invariably nest in bushes at a height of two
or three feet.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon says that during the winter these birds are quite common
throughout Louisiana, and the country about the Mississippi, as far as Kentucky.
They begin to depart from the South early in March, and move slowly
northward as the season advances. He states that they begin to nest in
May, and raise three broods in a season. This is not the case in New England,
where they do not often have more than a single brood.</p>

<p>Their nests are constructed in a manner very similar to those of the Chipping
Sparrow, loosely made of a few stems of vegetables, grasses, and sedges,
and lined with hair or fine rootlets. Those placed on the ground are larger
and more bulky, and those wrought into the twigs of a bush are made with
<!--015.png--><!--Plate 27-->
<!--016.png--><!--blank page-->
<!--017.png--><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span>
more care and neatness of interweaving. The eggs are usually five in number,
of an oblong-oval shape. The ground is a whitish clay-color, marked
more or less fully with blotches of a ferruginous-brown. In some these
markings are few, and arranged only about the larger end. In others they
are generally diffused, and impart a deep ferruginous color to the whole egg,
and disguise or conceal the ground. They vary also in size,&mdash;in length
from .70 to .63 of an inch, and in breadth from .52 to .50. Their usual size
is .70 by .52.</p>

<p>Two nests of this bird taken in Lynn, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, by Mr. George O. Welch, are
characteristic of their usual style in architecture. One of these has a diameter
of four and a height of two and a half inches. Its base, as well as the
great mass of its periphery, is made of a very loose intertwining of minute
stems of vegetables and dry grasses. The ends of these project from the
exterior of the nest at the upper rim, and present a very peculiar appearance,
as of an enclosure of palisades. The interior is lined with horsehair. The
other is made of similar materials, of a less rigid character and closer texture.
Its rim presents the same peculiarities of projecting ends, arranged
like a fence above the nest itself. Its dimensions also are about the same. It
is, however, much more compactly constructed, with thicker walls and a less
open network of dry grasses, and stiff wiry stems of dried plants intermixed
with a few pine leaves. The whole is very carefully and warmly lined
with horsehair and the softer fur of small quadrupeds. These nests contained,
one three, and the other four eggs.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Chipping Sparrow, so familiar to all in the eastern
portion of the United States, is not only one of the most abundant, but one
of the most widely distributed of our North American birds. It is found
from the Atlantic to the Pacific in its two races, and breeds from Georgia
to the Arctic Circle. At different seasons of the year it is found in all portions
of North America to Mexico. Along the Atlantic coast it nests at
least as far north as New Brunswick and Nova Scotia; in the extreme
northern portion of the latter Province I found it one of the most abundant
birds.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Robert Kennicott met with them in considerable numbers at
Fort Resolution, on Great Slave Lake, and there he obtained quite a number
of their nests, all of which were in trees or bushes, from two to three feet
above the ground. These were all met with between the 1st and the 26th
of June. Mr. B. R Ross also met with these birds in considerable numbers
at Fort Simpson and at Fort Rae.</p>

<p>On the Pacific coast the Chipping Sparrow is stated by Dr. Cooper to be
quite as abundant in the northern parts of California, and in Oregon and
Washington Territory, as on the Atlantic coast. He found them wintering
in the Colorado Valley in large numbers, but met with none about San Diego.
They spend their summers in the northern part of California, building their
nests, as with us, in the shrubbery of the gardens, and coming familiarly
about the doorsteps to pick up crumbs. In autumn they collect in large
flocks, and frequent the open fields and pastures. Dr. Cooper found them in
flocks on Catalina Island in June, but could discover no nests. They were
all old birds, and the conclusion was that they had delayed their more northern
migrations.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley found this species extremely abundant in the open districts
on the Columbia River, as well as upon the gravelly prairies of the Puget
Sound district. It is not named as having been met with by Mr. Dall or
any of the Russian Telegraph party in Alaska.</p>

<p>It was found in abundance during the summer by Mr. Ridgway in all the
wooded portions of the country of the Great Basin. He did not meet with
any among the cottonwoods of the river-valleys, its favorite haunts appearing
to be the cedars and the nut-pines of the mountains. In July and
August, in such localities, on the East Humboldt Mountains, it was not only
the most numerous species, but also very abundant, nesting in the trees.
About the middle of August they congregated in large numbers, preparing for
their departure.</p>

<p><!--019.png--><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span>
At Sacramento it was also very abundant among the groves of small oaks.
He could not observe the slightest difference in habits or notes between the
eastern and the western specimens of this form. He found them breeding
at Salt Lake City, June 19, the nest being in a scrub-oak, six feet from the
ground.</p>

<p>In Arizona, Dr. Coues found the Chippy a very abundant summer resident,
arriving the third week of March and remaining until the latter part of
November. A few may spend the winter there. As described, it seems
more gregarious than it is with us, arriving in the spring, and remaining for
a month or more in large flocks of fifty or upwards. In New England they
always come in pairs, and only assemble in flocks just on the eve of their
departure. Mr. Dresser met with these Sparrows, and obtained specimens
of them, near San Antonio, on the 10th of April. Dr. Heermann, in his
Report upon the birds observed in Lieutenant Williamson’s route between
the <abbr title="thirty-second">32d</abbr> and 35th parallels, speaks of finding this species abundant.</p>

<p>Dr. Gerhardt found this Sparrow not uncommon in the northern portions
of Georgia, where it is resident throughout the year, and where a few remain
in the summer to breed. Dr. Coues also states that a limited number summer
in the vicinity of Columbia, <abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr>, but that their number is insignificant
compared with those wintering there between October and April. They
collect in large flocks on their arrival, and remain in companies of hundreds
or more.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumichrast states that it is a resident bird in the temperate region of
Vera Cruz, Mexico, where it remains throughout the year, and breeds as
freely and commonly as it does within the United States.</p>

<p>Although found throughout the country in greater or less numbers, they
are noticeably not common in the more recent settlements of the West, as on
the unsettled prairies of Illinois and Iowa. Mr. Allen found them quite
rare in both States, excepting only about the older settlements. As early
as the first week in April, 1868, I noticed these birds very common and
familiar in the streets of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, especially so in the business part of that
city, along the wharves and near the grain-stores, seeking their food on the
ground with a confidence and fearlessness quite unusual to it in such situations.</p>

<p>The tameness and sociability of this bird surpass that of any of the birds
I have ever met with in New England, and are only equalled by similar
traits manifested by the Snowbird (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">J. hyemalis</i>) in Pictou. Those that live
about our dwellings in rural situations, and have been treated kindly, visit
our doorsteps, and even enter the houses, with the greatest familiarity and
trust. They will learn to distinguish their friends, alight at their feet, call
for their accustomed food, and pick it up when thrown to them, without the
slightest signs of fear. One pair which, summer after summer, had built
their nest in a fir-tree near my door, became so accustomed to be fed that
they would clamor for their food if they were any morning forgotten. One
<!--020.png--><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>
of these birds, the female, from coming down to the ground to be fed with
crumbs, soon learned to take them on the flat branch of the fir near her nest,
and at last to feed from my hand, and afterwards from that of other members
of the family. Her mate, all the while, was comparatively shy and distrustful,
and could not be induced to receive his food from us or to eat in our
presence.</p>

<p>This Sparrow is also quite social, keeping on good terms and delighting
to associate with other species. Since the introduction of the European
House Sparrow into Boston, I have repeatedly noticed it associating with
them in the most friendly relations, feeding with them, flying up with them
when disturbed, and imitating all their movements.</p>

<p>The Chipping Sparrow has very slight claims to be regarded as one of our
song-birds. Its note of complaint or uneasiness is a simple <i class="birdcall">chip</i>, and its
song, at its best, is but a monotonous repetition of a single note, sounding
like the rapid striking together of two small pebbles. In the bright days of
June this unpretending ditty is kept up incessantly, hours at a time, with
only rare intermissions.</p>

<p>The nest of this bird is always in trees or bushes. I have in no instance
known of its being built on the ground. Even at the Arctic regions, where
so many of our tree-builders vary from this custom to nest on the ground,
no exceptional cases are reported in regard to it, all its nests being upon
trees or in bushes. These are somewhat rudely built, often so loosely that
they may readily be seen through. Externally they are made of coarse
stems of grasses and vegetable branches, and lined with the hair of the
larger animals.</p>

<p>These birds are devoted parents, and express great solicitude whenever
their nests are approached or meddled with. They feed their young almost
exclusively with the larvæ of insects, especially with young caterpillars.
When in neighborhoods infested with the destructive canker-worm, they will
feed their young with this pest in incredible numbers, and seek them from a
considerable distance. Living in a district exempt from this scourge, yet but
shortly removed from them, in the summer of 1869, I noticed one of these
Sparrows with its mouth filled with something which inconvenienced it to
carry. It alighted on the gravel walk to adjust its load, and passed on to its
nest, leaving two canker-worms behind it, which, if not thus detected, would
have introduced this nuisance into an orchard that had previously escaped,
showing that though friends to those afflicted they are dangerous to their
neighbors. This Sparrow is also the frequent nurse of the Cow Blackbird,
rearing its young to the destruction of its own, and tending them with
exemplary fidelity.</p>

<p>Their eggs, five in number, are of an oblong-oval shape, and vary greatly
in size. They are of a bluish-green color, and are sparingly spotted about
the larger end with markings of umber, purple, and dark blackish-brown,
intermingled with lighter shadings of faint purple. The largest specimen
<!--021.png--><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>
I have ever noticed of this egg, found in the Capitol Grounds, Washington,
measures .80 by .58 of an inch; and the smallest, from Varrell’s Station, <abbr title="Georgia">Ga.</abbr>,
measures .60 by .50. Their average measurement is about .70 by .54. They
are all much pointed at the smaller end.</p>

<p>The ashy collar is quite conspicuous, and streaked above with brown.
The rump is immaculate. The streaks on the feathers of the crown almost
form continuous lines, about six in number. The brown line above the ear-coverts
is a post-ocular one. That on the side of the chin forms the lower
border of a white maxillary stripe which widens and curves around behind
the ear-coverts, fading into the ashy of the neck. The wing-feathers are all
margined with paler, and there is an indication of two light bands across the
ends of the coverts.</p>

<p>The young of this species is thickly streaked beneath over the throat,
breast, and belly, with brown, giving to it an entirely different appearance
from the adult. The streaks in the upper parts, too, are darker and more
conspicuous. The margins of the feathers are rather more rusty.</p>

except <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. breweri</i> (which see), in the dark streaks and median ashy stripe on

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Clay-colored Bunting was first discovered by Richardson,
and described by Swainson, in the Fauna <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Boreali-Americana">Bor.-Amer.</abbr> The only statement
made in regard to it is that it visited the Saskatchewan in considerable numbers,
frequented the farm-yard at Carlton House, and was in all respects as
familiar and confiding as the common House Sparrow of Europe.</p>

<p>The bird given by Mr. Audubon as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pallida</i> has been made by Mr.
Cassin a different species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. breweri</i>, and the species the former gives in his
seventh volume of the Birds of America as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Emberiza shattucki</i> is really this
species. It was found by Mr. Audubon’s party to the Yellowstone quite
abundant throughout the country bordering upon the Upper Missouri. It
seemed to be particularly partial to the small valleys found, here and there,
along the numerous ravines running from the interior and between the hills.
Its usual demeanor is said to greatly resemble that of the common Chipping
Sparrow, and, like that bird, it has a very monotonous ditty, which it seems to
delight to repeat constantly, while its mate is more usefully employed in the
duties of incubation. When it was approached, it would dive and conceal
itself amid the low bushes around, or would seek one of the large clusters of
wild roses so abundant in that section. The nest of this species is mentioned
as having been usually placed on a small horizontal branch seven or
eight feet from the ground, and occasionally in the broken and hollow
branches of trees. These nests are also stated to have been formed of
slender grasses, but in so slight a manner as, with their circular lining of
horse or cattle hair, to resemble as much as possible the nest of the common
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">socialis</i>. The eggs were five in number, and are described as being blue
with reddish-brown spots. These birds were also met with at the Great
Slave Lake region by Mr. Kennicott, in the same neighborhood by B. R.
<!--023.png--><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>
Ross and J. Lockhart, and in the Red River settlements by Mr. C. A. Hubbard
and Mr. Donald Gunn.</p>

<p>Captain Blakiston noted the arrival of this bird at Fort Carlton on the
21st of May. He speaks of its note as very peculiar, resembling, though
sharper than, the buzzing made by a fly in a paper box, or a faint imitation
of the sound of a watchman’s rattle. This song it utters perched on some
young tree or bush, sometimes only once, at others three or four times in
quick succession.</p>

<p>Their nests appear to have been in all instances placed in trees or in
shrubs, generally in small spruces, two or three feet from the ground. In
one instance it was in a clump of small bushes not more than six inches
from the ground, and only a few rods from the buildings of Fort Resolution.</p>

<p>Both this species and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. breweri</i> were found by Lieutenant Couch at
Tamaulipas in March, 1855. It does not appear to have been met with by
any other of the exploring expeditions, but in 1864, for the first time, as Dr.
Heermann states, to his knowledge, these birds were found quite plentiful
near San Antonio, Texas, by Mr. Dresser. This was in April, in the fields
near that town. They were associating with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melospiza lincolni</i> and
other Sparrows. They remained about San Antonio until the middle of
May, after which none were observed.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are of a light blue, with a slight tinge of greenish,
and are marked around the larger end with spots and blotches of a purplish-brown,
rather finer, perhaps, than in the egg of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. socialis</i>, though very similar
to it. They average .70 of an inch in length, and vary in breadth from
.50 to .52 of an inch.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Specific Characters"><span class="sc">Sp. Char.</span></abbr>
Similar to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. pallida</i>; the markings including the nuchal collar more
obsolete; no distinct median and superciliary light stripes. The crown streaked with
black. Some of the feathers on the sides with brown shafts. Length, 5 inches; wing,
2.50. Young streaked beneath, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pallida</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Rocky Mountains of United States to the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>This race is very similar to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. pallida</i>, and requires close and critical
comparison to separate it. The streaks on the back are narrower, and the
central ashy and lateral whitish stripes of the crown are scarcely, if at all,
appreciable. The clear unstreaked ash of the back of the neck, too, is
mostly wanting. The feathers along the sides of the body, near the tibia,
<!--024.png--><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>
and occasionally elsewhere on the sides, have brownish shafts, not found in
the other. The differences are perhaps those of race, rather than of species,
though they are very appreciable.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species bears a very close resemblance to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. pallida</i> in
its external appearance, but there are certain constant differences which, with
the peculiarities of their distinctive distributions and habits, seem to establish
their specific separation. The present bird is found from the Pacific
coast to the Rocky Mountains, and from the northern portion of California
to the Rio Grande and Mexico. Dr. Kennerly found it in February, 1854,
throughout New Mexico, from the Rio Grande to the Great Colorado, along
the different streams, where it was feeding upon the seeds of several kinds
of weeds.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann, while accompanying the surveying party of Lieutenant
Williamson, between the <abbr title="thirty-second">32d.</abbr> and 35th parallels, found these Sparrows
throughout his entire route, both in California and in Texas. On the passage
from the Pimos villages to Tucson he observed large flocks gleaning
their food among the bushes as they were moving southward. In the Tejon
valley, during the fall season, he was constantly meeting them associated
with large flocks of other species of Sparrows, congregated around the cultivated
fields of the Indians, where they find a bountiful supply of seeds.
For this purpose they pass the greater part of the time upon the ground.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse also met with this Sparrow throughout New Mexico,
wherever food and water were to be found in sufficient quantity to sustain
life.</p>

<p>In Arizona, near Fort Whipple, Dr. Coues states that this bird is a rare
summer resident. He characterizes it as a shy, retiring species, keeping
mostly in thick brush near the ground.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway states that he found this interesting little Sparrow, while
abundant in all fertile portions, almost exclusively an inhabitant of open
situations, such as fields or bushy plains, among the artemesia especially,
where it is most numerous. It frequents alike the valleys and the mountains.
At Sacramento it was the most abundant Sparrow, frequenting the
old fields. In this respect it very much resembles the eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spizella
pusilla</i>, from which, however, it is in many respects very different.</p>

<p>The song of Brewer’s Sparrow, he adds, for sprightliness and vivacity is
not excelled by any other of the North American Fringillidæ, being inferior
only to that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chondestes grammaca</i> in power and richness, and even
excelling it in variety and compass. Its song, while possessing all the plaintiveness
of tone so characteristic of the eastern Field Sparrow, unites to this
quality a vivacity and variety fully equalling that of the finest Canary.
This species is not resident, but arrives about the 9th of April. He found
its nest and eggs in the Truckee Reservation, early in June. The nests
were in sage-bushes about three feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found small flocks of this species at Fort Mohave, after March
<!--025.png--><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>
20, frequenting grassy spots among the low bushes, and a month later they
were singing, he adds, much like a Canary, but more faintly. They are presumed
to remain in the valley all summer.</p>

<p>The eggs, four in number, are of a light bluish-green color, oblong in
shape, more rounded at the smaller end than the eggs of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">socialis</i>, and the
ground is more of a green than in those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. pallida</i>. They are marked and
blotched in scattered markings of a golden-brown color. These blotches are
larger and more conspicuous than in the eggs of the other species. They
measure .70 by .51 of an inch.</p>

Tail elongated, deeply forked and divaricated. General color bluish-ash,
paler beneath, and turning to white on the middle of the belly. Interscapular region
yellowish-rusty, streaked with black. Forehead, loral region, and side of head as far as
eyes, chin, and upper part of throat black. Quills and tail-feathers very dark brown, edged
with ashy. Edges of coverts like the back. No white bands on the wings. Bill red,
feet dusky. Immature birds, and perhaps adult female, without any black on head.
Length, 5.50; wing, 2.50; tail, 3.00.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Mexico, just south of the Rio Grande;
Fort Whipple, <abbr title="Arizona">Ariz.</abbr> (<span class="sc">Coues</span>); Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>

<p>This species is about the size of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. pusilla</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. socialis</i>, resembling the
former most in its still longer tail. This is more deeply forked and divaricated,
with broader feathers than in either. The wing is much rounded; the
fourth quill longest; the first almost the shortest of the primaries.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species is a Mexican bird, found only within the limits of
the United States along the borders. But little is known as to its history.
It is supposed to be neither very abundant nor to have an extended area of
distribution. It was met with by Dr. Coues in the neighborhood of Fort
Whipple, Arizona, where it arrives in April and leaves again in October,
collecting, before its departure, in small flocks. In the spring he states that
it has a very sweet and melodious song, far surpassing in power and melody
the notes of any other of this genus that he has ever heard.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues furnishes me with the following additional information in regard
to this species: “This is not a common bird at Fort Whipple, and was only
observed from April to October. It unquestionably breeds in that vicinity,
as I shot very young birds, in August, wanting the distinctive head-markings
of the adult. A pair noticed in early April were seemingly about breeding,
as the male was in full song, and showed, on dissection, highly developed
<!--026.png--><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>
sexual organs. The song is very agreeable, not in the least recalling the
monotonous ditty of the Chip Bird, or the rather weak performances of some
other species of the genus. In the latter part of summer and early autumn
the birds were generally seen in small troops, perhaps families, in weedy
places, associating with the western variety of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spizella socialis</i>, as well as with
Goldfinches.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Couch met with individuals of this species at Agua Nueva, in
Coahuila, Mexico, in May, 1853. They were found in small flocks among
the mountains. Their nest and eggs are unknown.</p>

<p>This genus differs from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zonotrichia</i> in the
shorter, more graduated tail, rather longer
hind toe, much more rounded wing, which is
shorter; the tertiaries longer; the first quill
almost the shortest, and not longer than the
tertials. The under parts are spotted; the
crown streaked, and like the back.</p>

<p>There are few species of American birds
that have caused more perplexity to the
ornithologist than the group of which <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melospiza melodia</i> is the type. Spread
<!--027.png--><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>
over the whole of North America, and familiar to every one, we find each
region to possess a special form (to which a specific name has been given),
and yet these passing into each other by such insensible gradations as to
render it quite impossible to define them as species. Between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. melodia</i>
of the Atlantic States and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. insignis</i> of Kodiak the difference seems
wide; but the connecting links in the intermediate regions bridge this over
so completely that, with a series of hundreds of specimens before us, we
abandon the attempt at specific separation, and unite into one no less than
eight species previously recognized.</p>

<p>Taking, then, the common Song Sparrow of the Eastern Atlantic States
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. melodia</i>) as the starting-point, and proceeding westward, we find quite a
decided difference (in a variety <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fallax</i>) when we reach the Middle Province,
or that of the Rocky Mountains. The general tints are paler, grayer, and
less rusty; the superciliary stripe anteriorly more ashy; the bill, and especially
the legs, more dusky, the latter not at all to be called yellow. The bill
is perhaps smaller and, though sometimes equal to the average of eastern
specimens, more slender in proportion. In some specimens (typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fallax</i>) the
streaks are uniform rufous without darker centres,&mdash;a feature I have not
noticed in eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melodia</i>. Another stage (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">heermanni</i>) is seen when we reach
the Pacific coast of California, in a darker brown color (but not rufous).
Here the bill is rather larger than in <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fallax</i>, and the legs colored more
like typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melodia</i>. In fact, the bird is like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melodia</i>, but darker. The
stripes on the back continue well defined and distinct. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. samuelis</i>
(=<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gouldi</i>) may stand as a smaller race of this variety.</p>

<p>Proceeding northward along the Pacific coast, another form (<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">guttata</i>),
peculiar to the coast of California, is met with towards and beyond the
mouth of the Columbia (coming into Southern California in winter). This
is darker in color, more rufous; the stripes quite indistinct above, in fact,
more or less obsolete, and none, either above or below, with darker or blackish
centres. The sides, crissum, and tibia are washed with ochraceous-brown,
the latter perhaps darkest. The bill is proportionally longer and
more slender. This race becomes still darker northward, until at Sitka
(<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rufina</i>)
it shows no rufous tints, but a dusky olive-brown instead, including
the streaks of the under parts. The markings of the head and
back are appreciable, though not distinct. The size has become considerably
larger than in eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melodia</i>, the average length of wing being 3.00,
instead of 2.60.</p>

<p>The last extreme of difference from typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melodia</i> of the east is seen in
the variety <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">insignis</i> from Kodiak. Here the size is very large: length, 7.00;
extent, 10.75; wing, 3.20. The bill is very long (.73 from forehead), the
color still darker brown and more uniform above; the median light stripe
of vertex scarcely appreciable in some specimens; the superciliary scarcely
showing, except as a whitish spot anteriorly. The bill and feet have become
almost black.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Specific Characters"><span class="sc">Sp. Char.</span></abbr>
General tint of upper parts rufous and distinctly streaked with rufous-brown,
dark-brown, and ashy-gray. The crown is rufous, with a superciliary and median stripe of
dull gray, the former lighter; nearly white anteriorly, where it sometimes has a faint
shade of yellow, principally in autumn; each feather of the crown with a narrow streak
of black forming about six narrow lines. Interscapulars black in the centre, then rufous,
then pale grayish on the margin, these three colors on each feather very sharply contrasted.
Rump grayer than upper tail-coverts, both with obsolete dark streaks. There is
<!--030.png--><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>
a whitish maxillary stripe, bordered above and below by one of dark rufous-brown, and
with another from behind the eye. The under parts are white; the jugulum and sides
of body streaked with clear dark-brown, sometimes with a rufous suffusion. On the
middle of the breast these marks are rather aggregated so as to form a spot. No distinct
white on tail or wings. Length of male, 6.50; wing, 2.58; tail, 3.00. Bill pale brown
above; yellowish at base beneath. Legs yellowish.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Eastern United States to the high Central Plains.</p>

<p>Specimens vary somewhat in having the streaks across the breast more or
less sparse, the spot more or less distinct. In autumn the colors are more
blended, the light maxillary stripe tinged with yellowish, the edges of the
dusky streaks strongly suffused with brownish-rufous.</p>

<p>The young bird has the upper parts paler, the streaks more distinct; the
lines on the head scarcely appreciable. The under parts are yellowish; the
streaks narrower and more sharply defined dark brown.</p>

<p>As already stated, this species varies more or less from the above description
in different parts of North America, its typical races having received
specific names, which it is necessary to retain for them as varieties.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Song Sparrow of eastern North America has an
extended range of distribution, and is resident throughout the year in a large
part of the area in which it breeds. It nests from about South Carolina
north to the British Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the
east, and to a not well-defined limit in British America. The most northern
points to which it has been traced are the plains of the Saskatchewan and
the southern shore of Lake Winnepeg, in which latter place Mr. Kennicott
found it breeding. It is said by Dr. Coues to breed in South Carolina, and
by Mr. Audubon in Louisiana, but I have never seen any of their eggs from
any point south of Washington. In winter it is found from Massachusetts,
where only a few are observed, to Florida. It is most abundant at this
period in North and South Carolina. It is not mentioned in Dr. Gerhardt’s
list as being found in Northern Georgia at any season of the year.
Mr. Ridgway informs me that it does not breed in Southern Illinois. Its
song is not popularly known there, though he has occasionally heard it just
before these Sparrows were leaving for the north. This species winters there
in company with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z. albicollis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z. leucophrys</i>, associating with the former,
and inhabiting brush-heaps in the clearings.</p>

<p>To Massachusetts, where specimens have been taken in every month of the
year, and where they have been heard to sing in January, they return in
large numbers usually early in March, sometimes even in February. It is
probable that these are but migrants, passing farther north, and that our
summer visitants do not appear among us until the middle of April, or just
as they are about to breed. They reach Maine from the 15th to the 25th,
and breed there the middle of May. In Massachusetts they do not have
eggs until the first week in May, except in very remarkable seasons, usually
not until after the Bluebird has already hatched out her first brood, and a
week later than the Robin.</p>

<p><!--031.png--><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>
The tide of returning emigration begins to set southward early in October.
Collecting in small loose flocks, probably all of each group members of the
same family, they slowly move towards the south. As one set passes on,
another succeeds, until the latter part of November, when we no longer meet
with flocks, but solitary individuals or groups of two or three. These are
usually a larger and stouter race, and almost suggest a different species.
They are often in song even into December. They apparently do not go
far, and are the first to return. In early March they are in full song, and
their notes seem louder, clearer, and more vibratory than those that come to
us and remain to breed.</p>

<p>The Song Sparrow, as its name implies, is one of our most noted and conspicuous
singers. It is at once our earliest and our latest, as also our
most constant musician. Its song is somewhat brief, but is repeated at short
intervals, almost throughout the days of spring and early summer. It somewhat
resembles the opening notes of the Canary, and though less resonant
and powerful, much surpasses them in sweetness and expression. Plain and
homely as this bird is in its outward garb, its sweet song and its gentle confiding
manners render it a welcome visitor to every garden, and around every
rural home wherein such attractions can be appreciated. Whenever these
birds are kindly treated they readily make friends, and are attracted to our
doorsteps for the welcome crumbs that are thrown to them; and they will
return, year after year, to the same locality, whenever thus encouraged.</p>

<p>The song of this Sparrow varies in different individuals, and often changes,
in the same bird, in different parts of the year. It is even stated by an
observing naturalist&mdash;Mr. Charles S. Paine, of Randolph, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>&mdash;that he has
known the same bird to sing, in succession, nine entirely different sets of
notes, usually uttering them one after the other, in the same order. This was
noticed not merely once or during one season, but through three successive
summers. The same bird returned each season to his grounds, and came
each time provided with the same variety of airs.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall, who dwells with much force upon the beauty and earnestness
of expression of the song of this species, has also noticed and remarked
upon the power of individuals to vary their song, from time to time, with
very agreeable effect, but no one has recorded so remarkable an instance as
that thus carefully noted by Mr. Paine.</p>

<p>These birds are found in almost any cultivated locality where the grounds
are sufficiently open. They prefer the edges of open fields, and those of
meadows and low grounds, but are rarely found in woods or in thick bushes,
except near their outer edges. They nest naturally on the ground, and in such
situations a large majority build their nests. These are usually the younger
birds. A portion, almost always birds of several summers, probably taught
by sad experiences of the insecurity of the ground, build in bushes. A pair
which had a nest in an adjoining field had been robbed, by a cat, of their
young when just about to fly. After much lamentation, and an interval of a
<!--032.png--><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>
week, I found this same pair, which I easily recognized, building their nest
among some vines near my house, some eight feet from the ground. They
had abandoned my neighbor’s grounds and taken refuge close to my house.
This situation they resorted to afterwards for several successive summers, each
season building two nests, never using the same nest a second time, although
each time it was left as clean and in as good condition as when first made.
Indeed, this species is remarkable for its cleanliness, both in its own person
and in its care of nestlings and nests.</p>

<p>They feed their young chiefly with insects, especially small caterpillars;
the destructive canker-worm is one of their favorite articles of food, also the
larvæ of insects and the smaller moths. When crumbs of bread are given
them, they are eagerly gathered and taken to their nests.</p>

<p>In the Middle States they are said to have three broods in a season. This
may also be so in New England, but I have never known one pair to have
more than two broods in the same summer, even when both had been successfully
reared. Nests found after July have always been in cases where
some accident had befallen the preceding brood.</p>

<p>The nest of the Song Sparrow, whether built on ground, bush, or tree, is
always well and thoroughly made. Externally and at the base it consists of
stout stems of grasses, fibrous twigs of plants, and small sticks and rootlets.
These are strongly wrought together. Within is made a neat, well-woven
basket of fine long stems of grasses, rarely anything else. On the ground
they are usually concealed beneath a tuft of grass; sometimes they make a
covered passage-way of several inches, leading to their nest. When built
in a tree or shrub, the top is often sheltered by the branches or by dry
leaves, forming a covering to the structure.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Song Sparrow are five in number, and have an average
measurement of .82 by .60 of an inch. They have a ground of a clay-color
or dirty white, and are spotted equally over the entire egg with blotches of
a rusty-brown, intermingled with lighter shades of purple. In some these
markings are so numerous and confluent as to entirely conceal the ground-color;
in others they are irregularly diffused over different parts, leaving
patches unmarked. Occasionally the eggs are unspotted, and are then not
unlike those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leucosticte griseinucha</i>.</p>

Similar to <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melodia</i>,
but with the bill on the whole rather smaller,
more slender, and darker. Legs quite dusky, not yellow. Entire plumage of a more
<!--033.png--><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span>
grayish cast, including the whole superciliary stripe. The streaks on throat and jugulum
in spring are almost black, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melodia</i>; in autumn more rufous; in all cases quite as
sharply defined as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melodia</i>. The bill is nearly black in spring.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Middle Province of United States, to the Sierra Nevada.</p>

<p>This race, intermediate between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melodia</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">heermanni</i> in habitat, is,
however, hardly so in characters. The bill is more slender than in either,
being much like that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">guttata</i>, and the tail is longer in proportion to the
wing. In colors it is paler than either, the ground-cast above being nearly
clear grayish: the streaks, both on the back and jugulum, are more sparse,
as well as narrower; very frequently, in the winter plumage, those beneath
lack the central black, being wholly rufous; such is the case with the type.
In summer, however, they are frequently entirely black, the external rufous
having entirely disappeared. As in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">heermanni</i>, the rump is immaculate.
The young bird differs as does the adult, though the resemblance to those of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melodia</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">heermanni</i> is more close than in the adult. The very narrow
bill and long tail are the most characteristic features of form.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> In habits and song, Dr. Cooper can find no appreciable differences
between this variety and its nearest allies. He states that its nest,
which he found in a willow thicket, was composed of bark and fine twigs
and grass, and lined with hair. Its eggs he describes as bluish-white, blotched
and streaked with reddish-brown, and as measuring .74 by .55 of an inch.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found this species a common and permanent resident in Arizona,
and he pronounces its habits, manners, and voice precisely like those
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. melodia</i>. This species, he states, occurs throughout New Mexico,
Arizona, and a part of Southern California, and is particularly abundant in
the valley of the Colorado.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly observed this species only along Pueblo Creek, in the month
of January. It did not confine itself to the open valley, but was often
seen among the thick bushes that margined the creek, far up into the Aztec
Mountains, where the snow covered the ground. In its habits it resembled
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Poospiza belli</i>, being very restless and rapid in its motions, accompanying
them with a short chirp, feeding upon the seeds of the weeds that
remained uncovered by the snow. Its flight was also rapid and near the
earth. The bird being very shy, Dr. Kennerly found it difficult to procure
many specimens.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Ridgway, the Western Song Sparrow is one of the
most abundant of the resident species inhabiting the fertile portions of the
Great Basin. It principally occupies the willows along the streams, but is
also found in <i class="birdcall">tulé</i> sloughs of the river valleys. From a long acquaintance
with the Western Song Sparrows, Mr. Ridgway is fully convinced of the propriety
of recognizing this as a distinct variety from the eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. melodia</i>.
In all respects, as to habits, especially in its familiarity, it replaces at the
West the well-known Song Sparrow of the East. When first heard, the
peculiar measure and delivery of its song at once attracts attention. The
<!--034.png--><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>
precision of style and method of utterance are quite distinct and constant
peculiarities. The song, though as pleasing, is not so loud as that of the
eastern Song Sparrow, while the measure is very different. He noted the
syllables of its song, and found them quite uniform. He expresses the song
thus: <i class="birdcall">Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha&mdash;wit´&mdash;tur´-r-r-r-r-r&mdash;tut</i>. The first six syllables as
to accent are exactly alike, but with a considerable interval or pause between
the first and second notes. The second to the fifth follow in rapid succession,
each being uttered with deliberation and distinctness. Then comes a
pause between the last “cha” and the “wit,” which is pronounced in a fine
metallic tone with a rising inflection, then another pause, and a liquid trill
with a falling inflection, the whole terminating abruptly with a very peculiar
“tut,” in an entirely different key from the other notes.</p>

<p>The nests and eggs were found in the Wahsatch Mountains, June 23.
The nests were generally among bushes, in willow thickets, along the streams,
about a foot from the ground. One of these nests found in a clump of
willows, about two feet from the ground and near a stream, is a compact,
firmly built nest, in the shape of an inverted dome. It is two and a half
inches in height, and about the same in diameter. Externally it is composed
of a coarse framework of strips of willow bark firmly bound around.
Within is a compactly woven inner nest, composed of straws, mingled
and interwoven with horse-hairs. The cavity has a depth and diameter of
two inches. The eggs, four in number, measure .85 by .63 of an inch. Their
form is a rounded oval, distinctly pointed at one end. They have a greenish-white
ground, marked and blotched with splashes of purplish and reddish
brown.</p>

Somewhat like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melodia</i>, but darker. The streaks on the back and under

winter plumage. The median stripe on vertex indistinct. General shade of coloration

<p>Of the various races of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. melodia</i>, this one approaches nearest the
typical style of the Atlantic region; agreeing with it in thicker bill and
shorter tail, as compared with the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fallax</i>, which occurs between them.
It differs from the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melodia</i>, however, in a more grayish cast to the
ground-color of the upper plumage, being olivaceous-gray, rather than
reddish; the black dorsal streaks are very much broader than the rusty ones,
<!--035.png--><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>
instead of about equal to them in width, and the edges to the interscapular
feathers are not appreciably paler than the prevailing shade, instead of being
hoary whitish, in strong contrast. In spring the “bridle” on the side of the
throat and the spots on the jugulum have the black of their central portion
in excess of their external rufous suffusion; but in autumn the rusty rather
predominates; at this season, too, the rusty tints above overspread the whole
surface, but the black streaks are left sharply defined. At all seasons, the
spots on the jugulum are broader and rather more numerous than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melodia</i>.
The young can scarcely be distinguished from those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melodia</i>, but they have
the dark streaks on the crown and upper tail-coverts considerably broader.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The California Song Sparrow has been named in honor of the
late Dr. Heermann, who first obtained specimens of this bird in the Tejon
Valley, and mistook them for the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zonotrichia guttata</i> of Gambel (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. rufina</i>),
from which they were appreciably different. Whether a distinct species
or only a local race, this bird takes the place and is the almost precise
counterpart, in most essential respects, of the Song Sparrow of the East.
The exact limits of its distribution, both in the migratory season and in that
of reproduction, have hardly yet been ascertained. It has been found in
California as far north as San Francisco, and to the south and southeast to
San Diego and the Mohave River.</p>

<p>The California Song Sparrow is the characteristic <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melospiza</i> in all that portion
of the State south of San Francisco. It is found, Dr. Cooper states, in
every locality where there are thickets of low bushes and tall weeds, especially
in the vicinity of water, and wherever unmolested it comes about the
gardens and houses with all the familiarity of the common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melodia</i>. The
ground, under the shade of plants or bushes, is their usual place of resort.
There they diligently search for their food throughout the day, and rarely fly
more than a few yards from the place, and remain about their chosen locality
from one year’s end to another, being everywhere a resident species. In the
spring they are said to perch occasionally on some low bush or tree, and sing
a lively and pleasant melody for an hour at a time. Each song, Dr. Cooper
remarks, is a complete little stanza of a dozen notes, and is frequently varied
or changed entirely for another of similar style, but quite distinct. Although
no two birds of this species sing just alike, there is never any difficulty in distinguishing
their songs when once heard. There is, he thinks, a similarity of
tone and style in the songs of all the species of true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melospiza</i>, which has
led other observers to consider them as of only one species, when taken in
connection with their other similarities in colors and habits.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found a nest, presumed to belong to this bird, at Santa Cruz,
in June. It was built in a dense blackberry-bush, about three feet from the
ground, constructed with a thick periphery and base of dry grasses and thin
strips of bark, and lined with finer grasses. The eggs were of a smoky
white, densely speckled with a dull brown. Although this bird was abundant
around Santa Cruz, he was only able, after much searching, to find two
<!--036.png--><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span>
of their nests. One was in a willow, close against the tree, and three feet
from the ground, containing, on the 11th of May, four eggs partially hatched.
This was built of coarse dry stems and leaves, lined with finer grasses and
horse-hair. It was five inches in external diameter, and four high. The
cavity was two and a half inches deep and two in diameter. These eggs
had a ground of greenish-white, and were blotched and spotted with a
purplish-brown, chiefly at the larger end. They were .82 by .62 of an inch
in measurement. The ground-color was paler and the spots were darker
than in eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z. gambeli</i>, the whole coloring much darker than in those of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. fallax</i>. This nest was apparently an old one used for a second brood.</p>

<p>Another nest found as late as July 10, and doubtless a second brood, was
in a thicket, six feet from the ground, and also contained four eggs. Dr.
Cooper states that he has seen the newly fledged young by the 7th of May.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann, in his account of this bird, which he supposed to be the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">guttata</i> of Dr. Gambel, states that he found it abundant throughout the
whole country over which he passed, and more especially so in the bushes
bordering the streams, ponds, and marshes. Its notes, sweet, and few in
number, resembled those of the common Song Sparrow. Its nests, usually
built in thick tufts of bushes, were composed externally of grasses and lined
with hair, and contained each four eggs, with a pale bluish-ash ground,
thickly covered with dashes of burnt umber. Eggs of this species, from near
Monterey, collected by Dr. Canfield, vary in measurement from .85 by .65 of
an inch to .88 by .70,&mdash;larger than any eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melospiza melodia</i> that I have
seen. Their ground-color is a light green. The blotches are large, distinct,
and more or less confluent, and of a blended reddish and purplish brown.
They are in some diffused over the entire egg, in others disposed around the
larger end.</p>

The above description is of a specimen in worn summer plumage, when
the markings have not the sharp definition seen in the autumnal plumage.
The autumnal plumage is as follows: Ground-color above grayish-olive,
outer surface of wings, with the crown, more rufous; crown with narrow,
and dorsal region with broad, stripes of black, the latter with scarcely a
perceptible rufous suffusion; crown with a distinct median stripe of ashy.
Streaks on jugulum, etc., broader than in the type, and with a slight rufous
suffusion. Wing, 2.20; tail, 2.35; bill from nostril .31, its depth .22;
tarsus .74; middle toe without claw, .60.</p>

<p>The type of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melospiza gouldi</i> resembles the last, and differs only in having
a more distinct rufous suffusion to the black markings; the measurements
are as follows: Wing, 2.20; tail, 2.35; bill, .33 by .23; tarsus, .73; middle
toe without claw, .59.</p>

<p>This is probably a dwarfed race of the common species, the very small
size being its chief distinctive character. The colors are most nearly like
those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">heermanni</i>, but are considerably darker, caused by an expansion of
the black and contraction of the rufous markings. The pattern of coloration
is precisely the same as in the other races. The present bird appears
to be peculiar to the coast region of California, the only specimens in the
collection being from the neighborhood of San Francisco.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Of the history, distribution, and general habits of this species,
nothing is known. It was found at Petaluma, <abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>, by Emanuel Samuels,
and described in the Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History in
1858. The following description of the nest and eggs of this bird, in the
Smithsonian collection, has been kindly furnished me by Mr. Ridgway.</p>

<p>Nests elaborate and symmetrical, cup-shaped, composed of thin grass-stems,
but externally chiefly of grass-blades and strips of thin inner bark.
Diameter about 3.50 inches; internal diameter 2.00, and internal depth 1.50;
external, 2.00. Egg measures .78 by .62; regularly ovate in shape; ground-color,
greenish-white; this is thickly sprinkled with purplish and livid ashy-brown,
the specks larger, and somewhat coalescent, around the larger circumference.

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Pacific coast of the United States to British Columbia.</p>

<p>A young bird from Napa Valley, <abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr> (12,912, Colonel A. J. Grayson),
probably referrible to this race, differs from the corresponding stage of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">heermanni</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fallax</i>,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melodia</i> in the following respects: the ground-color
above is much darker, being dull dingy-brown, and the dusky streaks
broader; the white beneath has a strong yellowish tinge, and the pectoral
streaks are very broad.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Dr. Cooper characterizes this species as the most northern and
mountain-frequenting representative of the Song Sparrows, being a resident
of the higher Sierra Nevada and on the borders of the evergreen forests
towards the Columbia, and thence northward, where it is the only species of
this genus, and where it is common down to the level of the sea. Specimens
have been obtained at Marysville in the spring, by Mr. Gruber.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper says that he has also met with this bird, and found it possessing
habits and songs entirely similar to those of the eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. melodia</i>,
and resembling also those of the more southern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. heermanni</i>. He was
never able to meet with one of their nests, as, like other forest birds, they are
more artful in concealing their treasures than birds that have become accustomed
to the society and protection of man, and who, no longer wild, select
gardens as the safest places in which to build. In the mild winters usual
about the mouth of the Columbia, these birds do not evince any disposition
to emigrate, but come familiarly around the houses for their food, when the
snow has buried their usual supply.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley remarks that this Finch is quite a common bird in the vicinity
of Puget Sound, and that it is there resident throughout the year. He has
found them in very different situations; some in thickets at the edges of
prairies, others in stranded drift-logs on open salt marshes, as well as in
swamps, and in the dense forests of the Douglass firs, peculiar to the northwest
coast. Its voice, he adds, is, during the breeding-season, singularly
sweet and melodious, surpassing that of the Meadow Lark in melody and
tone, but unequal to it in force.</p>

<p>This species is stated to be a constant resident in the district wherein it is
found, never ranging far from the thicket which contains its nest, or the
house in the neighborhood of which it finds food and protection. Almost
every winter morning, as well as during the summer, as Dr. Cooper states, its
cheerful song may be heard from the garden or the fence, as if to repay those
whose presence has protected it from its rapacious enemies. When unmolested,
<!--039.png--><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>
it becomes very familiar, and the old birds bring their young to the
door to feed, as soon as they can leave their nest. Their song is said to so
closely resemble that of the eastern bird, in melody and variety, that it is
impossible either to tell which is the superior or to point out the differences.
In wild districts it is always to be found near the sides of brooks, in thickets,
from which it jealously drives off other birds, whether of its own or other
species, as if it considered itself the proprietor. Its nest is built on the
ground or in a low bush. Dr. Cooper has seen newly fledged young as early
as May 6, at Olympia, though the rainy season was then hardly over.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall pronounces its song as sweeter and more varied in tone than
that of the Song Sparrow. He heard their cheerful notes throughout the
summer, and every fine day in winter until the month of November, particularly
in the morning, their song was still continued. Their nests and eggs
were not distinguishable from those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">F. melodia</i>.
The nests were composed
of dry grasses, lined with finer materials of the same, and occasionally with
deer’s hair. He states that they keep much in low ground and alluvial situations,
amidst rank weeds, willows, and brambles, where they are frequently
to be seen hopping about and searching after insects, in the manner of the
Swamp Sparrow, which they so much resemble in their plumage. They are
usually very solicitous for the safety of their young or for their nests and
eggs, keeping up an incessant chirp. They raise several broods in a season,
and are, like the Song Sparrow, also engaged nearly the whole of the summer
in the cares of rearing their young.</p>

<p>Mr. Townsend met with this species through several hundred miles of the
Platte country in great numbers, as well as on the banks of the Columbia,
generally frequenting the low bushes of wormwood (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Artemisia</i>). It appeared
also to be a very pugnacious species. Two of the males were often observed
fighting in the air, the beaten party going off crestfallen, and the conqueror
repairing to the nearest bush to celebrate his triumph by his lively and triumphant
strains. He again met with these birds, though not in abundance,
in June, 1825, at the mouth of the Lewis River, on the waters of the Columbia.</p>

<p>This Sparrow was also found very numerous at Sitka, by Mr. Bischoff, but
no mention is made of its habits.</p>

<p>There is little or no difference in specimens of this bird from the whole

A young bird from Fort Simpson, on the Mackenzie, is much like the adult.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Lincoln’s Finch was first met with by Mr. Audubon in Labrador,
and named in honor of one of his companions, Mr. Thomas Lincoln, now
residing at Dennysville, Maine, by whom the first specimen was procured.
His attention was attracted to it by the sweet notes of its song, which, he
states, surpass in vigor those of any of our American Sparrows with which
he was acquainted. He describes this song as a compound of the notes
of a Canary and a Woodlark of Europe. The bird was unusually wild, and
was procured with great difficulty. Other specimens, afterwards obtained,
did not exhibit the same degree of wildness, and they became more common
as the party proceeded farther north. He did not meet with its nest.</p>

<p>He describes the habits of this species as resembling, in some respects,
those of the Song Sparrow. It mounts, like that bird, on the topmost twig of
some tall shrub to chant for whole hours at a time, or dives into the thickets
and hops from branch to branch until it reaches the ground in search of those
insects or berries on which it feeds. It moves swiftly away when it discovers
an enemy, and, if forced to take to flight, flies low and rapidly to a considerable
distance, jerking its tail as it proceeds, and throwing itself into the thickest
bush it meets. Mr. Audubon found it mostly near streams, and always
in the small valleys guarded from the prevalent cold winds of that country.</p>

<p><!--042.png--><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span>
He also describes this species as eminently petulant and pugnacious.
Two males would often pursue each other until the weaker was forced to
abandon the valley, and seek refuge elsewhere. He seldom saw more than
two or three pairs in a tract of several miles in extent. By the 4th of July
the young had left their nests and were following their parents. As from
that time the old birds ceased to sing, he inferred that they raised but one
brood in a season. Before he left Labrador these birds had all disappeared.</p>

<p>Although first discovered on the coast of Labrador, subsequent explorations
have shown this bird to be far more common at the West than it is at the
East, where indeed it is exceedingly rare. Not a specimen, that I am aware
of, has ever been found in Maine, although it probably does occasionally occur
there; and only a very few isolated individuals had been taken in Massachusetts
before the spring of 1872, when they were noticed by Mr. Brewster
and Mr. Henshaw in considerable numbers. These birds, seven or eight in
number, were shot, with two exceptions, in May, between the 14th and the
25th. Three were taken in Springfield by Mr. Allen, one in Newburyport
by Mr. Hoxie, two in Hudson by Mr. Jillson, and two in Cambridge by
Mr. Brewster. The latter were obtained, one in September and the other in
October. In May, 1872, Mr. Brewster obtained six others. Mr. Allen had
met with this Finch in Wayne County, <abbr title="New York"><span class="sc">N. Y.</span></abbr>, in May, where it was not
uncommon, and in Northern Illinois, where it was quite numerous. A few
have been taken near New York City, and in the neighborhood of Philadelphia,
where they are regarded as very rare. Professor Baird, however,
frequently met with them at Carlisle, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr></p>

<p>Farther west, from the Mississippi Valley to the Pacific, they are much
more common. Mr. Ridgway states that they occasionally winter in Southern
Illinois, where they frequent retired thickets near open fields. They
have been found breeding near Racine, <abbr title="Wisconsin"><span class="sc">Wis.</span></abbr>, by Dr. Hoy, and have been met
with also in Nebraska in considerable numbers; and, during the breeding-season,
Mr. Audubon met with them on the Upper Missouri.</p>

<p>From March to May Mr. Dresser found these birds very abundant in the
fields near the San Antonio River, and in some swampy grounds. They
seemed to prefer that sort of locality, and the banks of the river, keeping
among the flags and rushes. Their stomachs were found to contain small
seeds. Mr. Lincecum also met with a few in Washington County of the
same State.</p>

<p>It was not met with in Arizona by Dr. Coues, but Dr. Kennerly found it
in the month of February from the Big Sandy to the Great Colorado River.
It confined itself to the thick bushes along the streams, and when seen was
generally busily hopping from twig to twig in search of food. When started
up, its flight was very rapid and near the earth.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann obtained this species, not unfrequently, both in Northern
California and in the Tejon Valley. On all occasions he found it in company
with flocks of Sparrows, composed of several species.</p>

<p><!--043.png--><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 33]</span>
Lieutenant Couch took this species at Tamaulipas, Mexico, and at Brownsville,
Southwestern Texas, in March. It has also been seen in May, at the
Forks of the Saskatchewan, by Captain Blakiston.</p>

<p>Lincoln’s Finch was met with by Mr. Ridgway in abundance only during
its spring and fall migrations. Towards the last of April it was quite
common in wet brushy places in the vicinity of Carson City. It was next
observed in October among the willows bordering Deep Creek, in Northern
Utah. In the weedy pastures in Parley’s Park it was a common species,
frequenting the resorts of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Z. leucophrys</i>. A nest, with young, was discovered
near the camp. It was embedded in the ground, beneath a bush.
Its song he did not hear, only a single <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chuck</i>, almost as loud as that of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerella schistacea</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper reports this species as near San Diego about March 25. Large
flocks were then passing northward. During the day they kept among the
grass, and were rather shy and silent. They seemed to have a good deal of
the habits of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerculus</i>, and to differ much in their gregariousness, their
migratory habits, and their general form, from the other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melospizæ</i>. Dr.
Cooper did not meet with any of these birds in the Colorado Valley, nor has
he seen or heard of any having been found in California during the summer.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. lincolni</i> has been found breeding up to high Arctic latitudes. It was
met with by Mr. Kennicott at Fort Simpson and at Fort Resolution. At the
latter place its nests were found between the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> and the 14th of June.
They were also obtained in May, June, and July, at Fort Simpson, by Mr.
B. R. Ross, and at Yukon River, Fort Rae, Nulato, and other localities in the
extreme northern regions, by Messrs. Reid, Lockhart, Clarke, Kirkby, and
Dall. On Mt. Lincoln, Colorado, above eight thousand feet, Mr. Allen found
this Sparrow very numerous.</p>

<p>This Finch was found by Salvin about the reeds on the margin of Lake
Dueñas, Guatemala, in February, but was not common. It is common, in
the winter months, near Oaxaca, Mexico, where it was taken by Mr. Boucard.</p>

<p>Mr. Kennicott saw its nest June 14. This was on the ground, built in a
bunch of grass in rather an open and dry place, and containing five eggs.
The female permitted him to approach very close to her, until he finally
caught her on the nest with his beating-net. Another nest was placed
in a bunch of grass growing in the water of a small grassy pond. The
nest contained four eggs and one young bird.</p>

<p>The nest and eggs of this species had been previously discovered by Dr.
Hoy, near Racine. This is, I believe, the first instance in which it was identified
by a naturalist, as also the most southern point at which it has ever
been found. These eggs measure .74 by .60 of an inch. They have a pale
greenish-white ground, and are thickly marked with dots and small blotches
of a ferruginous-brown, often so numerous and confluent as to disguise and
partially conceal the ground.</p>

Middle of the crown uniform chestnut; forehead black; superciliary streak,
sides of head and back, and sides of neck, ash. A brown stripe behind the eye. Back
with broad streaks of black, which are edged with rusty yellow. Beneath whitish,
tinged with ashy anteriorly, especially across the breast, and washed with yellowish-brown
on the sides. A few obsolete streaks across the breast, which become distinct on
its sides. Wings and tail strongly tinged with rufous; the tertials black, the rufous
edgings changing abruptly to white towards the end. Length, 5.75; wing, 2.40.</p>

Eastern North America from the Atlantic to the Missouri; north to Fort Simpson.</p>

<p>In autumn the male of this species has the feathers of the crown each
with a black streak; and the centre of the crown with an indistinct light
stripe, materially changing its appearance.</p>

<p>The forehead is usually more or less streaked with black.</p>

<p>In the uncertainty whether the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fringilla georgiana</i> of Latham be not
rather the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Peucæa æstivalis</i> than the Swamp Sparrow, I think it best to
retain Wilson’s name. It certainly applies as well to the latter, which has
the black sub-maxillary streak, and the chin and throat more mouse-colored
than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">palustris</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Owing to the residence of this species in localities not favoring
frequent visits or careful explorations, and still more to its shy and retiring
habits, our writers have not been generally well informed as to the history
and general manners of this peculiar and interesting Sparrow. Its irregular
distribution, its abundance only in certain and unusually restricted localities,
its entire absence from all the surrounding neighborhood, and its secretiveness
wherever found, have all combined to throw doubt and obscurity
over its movements. Unless purposely looked for and perseveringly hunted
up, the Swamp Sparrow might exist in large numbers in one’s immediate
neighborhood and yet entirely escape notice. Even now its whole story
is but imperfectly known, and more careful investigation into its distribution
and general habits will doubtless clear up several obscure points in regard
to its movements.</p>

<p>From what is now known, we gather that it occurs throughout the eastern
portions of North America, from the Southern States, in which it passes the

wintry months, to high northern latitudes, where some find their way in the
breeding-season, extending as far to the west at least as the Missouri River
region.</p>

<p>Three specimens were obtained at Fort Simpson, by Mr. Kennicott, in September,
which indicates their probable summer presence in latitude 55<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, and
their near approach to the Pacific coast at the extreme northwestern portion
of their distribution. Audubon also met with them in Newfoundland and
in Labrador. They are known to breed as far to the south as Pennsylvania.
They have been taken in the eastern portion of Nebraska, and breed
in considerable numbers in Southern Wisconsin. Further investigations in
regard to its distribution will probably show it to be a much more widely distributed
as well as a more abundant bird than has been generally supposed.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway writes me that this bird winters in Southern Illinois, and
remains there very late in the spring, but he thinks that none remain to
breed.</p>

<p>Wilson states that it arrives in Pennsylvania early in April, where it frequents
low grounds and river-courses, rears two and sometimes three broods
in a season, and returns to the South as the cold weather commences. During
the winter, he met with them in large numbers in the immense cypress
swamps and extensive grassy flats of the Southern States, along the numerous
rivers and rice plantations. These places abounded with their favorite
seeds and other means of sustenance, and appeared to be their general
places of resort at this season. From the river Trent, in North Carolina, to
the Savannah River, and even farther south, Wilson found this species very
numerous. They were not found in flocks, but skulked among the reeds
and grass, were shy and timorous, and seemed more attached to the water
than any others of this family. In April large numbers pass through Pennsylvania
northward. Only a few remain behind, and these frequent the
swamps and the reedy borders of creeks and rivers. He found their nests
built in the ground, in tussocks of rank grass, surrounded by water, with
four eggs of a dirty-white ground, spotted with rufous. He has found them
feeding their young as late as the 15th of August. Their food seemed to be
principally grass-seeds, wild oats, and insects. He supposed them to have
no song, and that their only note was a single <i>cheep</i> uttered in a somewhat
hoarse tone. They flirt their tails as they fly, seldom or never take to trees,
but run and skulk from one low bush to another.</p>

<p>Except in regard to their song, Wilson’s account of their habits, so far as it
goes, is quite accurate, although this bird really does have quite a respectable
song, and one that improves as the season advances. At first it is only a
succession or repetition of a few monotonous trilling notes, which might
easily be mistaken for the song of the Field Sparrow, or even confounded
with the feebler chant of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">socialis</i>, although not so varied as the former,
and is much more sprightly and pleasing than the other. Still later its
music improves, and more effort is made. Like the Song Sparrow, it
<!--048.png--><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>
mounts some low twig, expands its tail-feathers, and gives forth a very
sprightly trill that echoes through the swampy thicket with an effect which,
once noticed and identified with the performer, is not likely to be ever mistaken.
Nuttall calls this song loud, sweet, and plaintive. It is to my ear
more sprightly than pathetic, and has a peculiarly ventriloquistic effect, as
if the performer were at a much greater distance than he really is.</p>

<p>Their food, when they first arrive, and that which they feed to their young,
consists very largely of insects, principally coleopterous ones, with such few
seeds as they can glean. After the breeding-season, when their young can
take care of themselves, they eat almost exclusively the ripened seeds of the
coarse water grasses and sedges. They are very devoted to their young, and
often display great solicitude for their safety, even when able to take care of
themselves, and often expose themselves to dangers they carefully avoid at
other times, and are thus more easily procured. At all other times they are
difficult to shoot, running, as they do, through the grass and tangled thickets,
and rarely rising on the wing. They dive from thicket to thicket with great
rapidity, and even when wounded have a wonderful power of running and
hiding themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon met with them, during autumn and winter, among the flat
sand-bars of the Mississippi, which are overgrown with rank grasses. Though
not in flocks, their numbers were immense. They fed on grass-seeds and
insects, often wading for the latter in shallow water in the manner of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tringidæ</i>, and when wounded and forced into the water swimming off to
the nearest shelter. He also met with these birds abundantly dispersed in
the swamps of Cuyaga Lake, as well as among those along the Illinois River
in the summer, and in the winter up the Arkansas River.</p>

<p>Mr. Townsend observed these birds on the head-waters of the Upper Missouri,
but did not meet with them beyond.</p>

<p>In Maine, Mr. Boardman gives it as a regular summer visitant at Calais,
arriving there as early as March, becoming common in May, and breeding in
that locality. Professor Verrill found it in Western Maine, a summer visitant
and breeding, but did not regard it as common. From my own experience, in
the neighborhood of Boston, I should have said the same as to its infrequency
in Eastern Massachusetts, yet in certain localities it is a very abundant summer
resident. Mr. William Brewster has found it breeding in large numbers
in the marshes of Fresh Pond, where it arrives sometimes as early as
the latter part of March, and where it remains until November. In the
western part of the State it is more common as a migratory bird, and has not
been found, in any numbers, stopping to breed. Mr. Allen never met with
any later than May 25. They were observed to be in company with the
Water Thrush, and to be in every way as aquatic in their habits. In the
autumn he again met with it from the last of September through October,
always in bushy marshes or wet places. Mr. McIlwraith states that in the
vicinity of Hamilton, Ontario, it is a common summer resident, breeding
<!--049.png--><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span>
there in marshy situations. At Lake Koskonong, in Wisconsin, Mr. Kumlien
has also met with these birds abundantly in suitable localities, and found
their nests and eggs quite plentiful.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway has recently found this Sparrow to be a very abundant winter
resident in Southern Illinois, where it inhabits swampy thickets, and
where it remains until May, but is not known to breed there.</p>

<p>They always nest on the ground, usually in a depression sheltered by a
tuft of grass. The nest is woven of fine grass-stems, but is smaller than
the nest of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. melodia</i>.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species, usually five in number, have an average measurement
of .78 by .60 of an inch. Their ground-color is usually a light green,
occasionally of a light clay, marked and blotched with reddish and purplish
brown spots, varying in size and number, occasionally forming a confluent
ring around the larger end.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Georgia; Florida; South Illinois, breeding (<span class="sc">Ridgway</span>). (Perhaps whole of
Southern States from Florida to South Illinois.)</p>

<p>Specimens from Southern Illinois (Wabash <abbr title="County">Co.</abbr>, July, 1871; coll. of R.
Ridgway) are similar to Florida examples.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Bachman’s Finch has only been known, until very recently, as
a species of a very restricted range, and confined within the limits of the
States of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Our principal, and for some
time our only, knowledge of its habits was derived from the account furnished
by Rev. Dr. Bachman to Mr. Audubon. That observing naturalist first
met with it in the month of April, 1832, near Parker’s Ferry, on the Edisto
River, in South Carolina. Dr. Henry Bryant afterwards met with this
species at Indian River, in Florida, where he obtained specimens of its nests
<!--052.png--><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 40]</span>
and eggs. Dr. Alexander Gerhardt also found these Sparrows common at
Varnell’s Station, in the northern part of Georgia. Professor Joseph Leconte
has taken it near Savannah, and Mr. W. L. Jones has also obtained several
specimens in Liberty County, in the same State.</p>

<p>After meeting with this species on the Edisto, Dr. Bachman ascertained,
upon searching for them in the vicinity of Charlestown, that they breed in
small numbers on the pine barrens, about six miles north of that city. He
was of the opinion that it is by no means so rare in that State as has been
supposed, but that it is more often heard than seen. When he first heard
it, the notes so closely resembled those of the Towhee Bunting that for a
while he mistook them for those of that bird. Their greater softness and
some slight variations at last induced him to suspect that the bird was
something different, and led him to go in pursuit. After that it was quite a
common thing for him to hear as many as five or six in the course of a morning’s
ride, but he found it almost impossible to get even a sight of the bird.
This is owing, not so much to its being so wild, as to the habit it has of
darting from the tall pine-trees, on which it usually sits to warble out its
melodious notes, and concealing itself in the tall broom-grass that is almost
invariably found in the places it frequents. As soon as it alights it runs off,
in the manner of a mouse, and hides itself in the grass, and it is extremely
difficult to get a sight of it afterwards.</p>

<p>It was supposed by Dr. Bachman&mdash;correctly, as it has been ascertained&mdash;to
breed on the ground, where it is always to be found when it is not singing.
He never met with its nest. In June, 1853, he observed two pairs of these
birds, each having four young. They were pretty well fledged, and were following
their parents along the low scrub-oaks of the pine lands.</p>

<p>Dr. Bachman regarded this bird as decidedly the finest songster of the
Sparrow family with which he was acquainted. Its notes are described as
very loud for the size of the bird, and capable of being heard at a considerable
distance in the pine woods where it occurs, and where at that season
it is the only singer.</p>

<p>He also states that, by the middle of November, they have all disappeared,
probably migrating farther south. It is quite probable that they
do not go beyond the limits of the United States, and that some remain in
South Carolina during the whole of winter, as on the 6th of February, the
coldest part of the year, Dr. Bachman found one of them in the long grass
near Charleston.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon says that on his return from Florida, in June, 1832, travelling
through both the Carolinas, he observed many of these Finches on the
sides of the roads cut through the pine woods of South Carolina. They
filled the air with their melodies. He traced them as far as the boundary
line of North Carolina, but saw none within the limits of that State. They
were particularly abundant about the Great Santee River.</p>

<p>This Finch, hitherto assumed to be an exclusively southeastern species, has
<!--053.png--><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 41]</span>
recently been detected by Mr. Ridgway in Southern Illinois, where it is a
summer resident, and where it breeds, but is not abundant. It inhabits old
fields, where, perched upon a fence-stake or an old dead tree, it is described
as chanting a very delightful song. It was first taken on the 12th of July,
1871, on the road about half-way between Mount Carmel and Olney. The
bird was then seen on a fence, and its unfamiliar appearance and fine song
at once attracted his notice as he was riding by. As several were heard
singing in the same neighborhood, it seemed common in that locality, and
as a young bird was taken in its first plumage there is no doubt that it is a
regular summer visitant of Southern Illinois, and breeds there. Mr. Ridgway
speaks of its song as one of the finest he has ever heard, most resembling
the sweet chant of the Field Sparrow, but is stronger, and varied
by a clear, high, and very musical strain. He describes its song as resembling
the syllables <i class="birdcall">thééééééé-til-lūt</i>, <i class="birdcall">lūt-lūt</i>, the first being a very fine trill
pitched in a very high musical key, the last syllable abrupt and metallic in
tone.</p>

<p>The food of this species, Dr. Bachman states, consists of the seeds of grasses,
and also of coleopterous insects, as well as of a variety of the small berries
so abundant in that part of the country. He speaks of its flight as swift,
direct, and somewhat protracted, and adds that it is often out of sight before
it alights.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues did not meet with this Sparrow in South Carolina, but he was
informed by Professor Leconte that it occurs about Columbia and elsewhere
in the State, frequenting open pine woods and old dry fields.</p>

<p>Dr. Bryant met with its nest in Florida, April 20. It was similar, in construction,
to that of the Savannah Sparrow, and contained five eggs. It was
the only Sparrow found by him in the pine barrens near Enterprise, and
was only seen occasionally, when it was a very difficult bird to shoot, as it
runs round in the grass more like a mouse than a bird, and will not fly
until almost trodden on, then moving only a few feet at a time.</p>

<p>The nests of this bird, found by Dr. Bryant in Florida and by Dr. Gerhardt
in Northern Georgia, were all placed upon the ground and concealed in tufts
of thick grass, and constructed entirely of coarse wiry grasses, with no other
lining than this material. The eggs, four in number, are of a pure, almost
brilliant white, of a rounded oval shape, and measure .74 by .60 of an inch.</p>

<p>This race has a considerable resemblance to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. æstivalis</i>, but differs in
some appreciable points. The brown of the upper parts is paler, and the
ashy edging to the feathers appears rather less extensive. The dark brown
blotches on the back are of greater extent, the black streaks on the back
confined to a mere streak along the shaft. There is less of an olive tinge
across the breast.</p>

<p>The proportions of the present race differ more from those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æstivalis</i>
than do the colors, the bill being more slender, and the wings and tail considerably

and upper tail-coverts, into transverse spots, those on the upper tail-coverts being large

<p>In the Birds of North America, the specimen characterized on <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 637 of the
present work as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æstivalis</i>, <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arizonæ</i>, was referred to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. cassini</i>, those
specimens which are here retained as such being considered as in quite immature
plumage. A more recent examination of additional material, however,
has compelled us to change our view. In consequence of the similarity
of the specimen in question to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æstivalis</i>, as noted in the article referred to
above, the general acceptation of the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cassini</i> has been that of a term
designating a variety of the common species; but we have as the result of the
investigation in question found it necessary to retain under the head of
“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cassini</i>” only the typical specimens from the Rio Grande region, and refer
the supposed aberrant specimen to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æstivalis</i>. In this Los Nogales specimen
we find existing such differences in proportions and colors as are sufficient to
warrant our bestowing upon it a new name, and establishing it as the Middle
Province race of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æstivalis</i>, in this way connecting the South Atlantic and
Mexican races (<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æstivalis</i>
and <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">botterii</i>) by a more similar form than
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. cassini</i>, which must be set apart as an independent form,&mdash;in all
probability a good species. Several facts are favorable to this view. First,
we have of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. cassini</i> specimens which are beyond question in perfect
adult plumage, and others which are undoubtedly immature; they differ
from each other only in such respects as would be expected, and agree
substantially in other characters, by which they are distinguished from the
different styles of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æstivalis</i>. Secondly, the region to be filled by a peculiar
race of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æstivalis</i> is represented by the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arizonæ</i>, which is undoubtedly
referable to that species; thus we have in one province these two different
forms, which therefore are probably distinct.</p>

<p>The present bird is hardly less distinct from the races of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æstivalis</i> than is
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ruficeps</i>; and we would be as willing to consider all the definable forms presented
in the synopsis as varieties of a single species, as to refer the present
bird to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æstivalis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This Finch, in its general appearance, as well as in respect to
habits, nesting, and eggs, is quite similar to Bachman’s Finch. It was first
met with by Dr. Woodhouse, in the expedition to the Zuñi River, when he
found it in Western Texas. He shot it on the prairies near San Antonio, on
the 25th of April, 1851, mistaking it for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerculus savanna</i>, which, in its
habits, it seemed to him very much to resemble, but upon examination it was
found to be totally distinct.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann afterwards, being at Comanche Springs in Texas, had his
<!--056.png--><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>
attention attracted by the new note of a bird unfamiliar to him. It was
found, after some observation, to proceed from this species. He describes
it as rising with a tremulous motion of its wings some twenty feet or more,
and then descending again, in the same manner, to within a few yards of
the spot whence it started, and as accompanying its entire flight with a
lengthened and pleasing song. The country in that neighborhood is very
barren, covered with low stunted bushes, in which the bird takes refuge on
being alarmed, gliding rapidly through the grass and shrubbery, and very
adroitly and effectually evading its pursuer. He observed them during four
or five days of the journey of his party, and after that saw no more of them.
They seemed, at the time, to be migrating, though their continued and oft-repeated
song also showed that they were not far from readiness for the
duties of incubation.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Peucæa cassini</i> is said, by Mr. Sumichrast, to be a resident species in
the valley of Orizaba, in the State of Vera Cruz, Mexico, and to be generally
distributed throughout the temperate region of that district. It is
very probable, however, that he has in view the Mexican race of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. æstivalis</i>
(<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">botterii</i>), and not the present species.</p>

<p>Mr. J. A. Allen, who considers this bird only a western form of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. æstivalis</i>,
mentions (<abbr title="American">Am.</abbr> Naturalist, May, 1872) finding it quite frequently near
the streams in Western Kansas, where its sweetly modulated song greets
the ear with the first break of dawn, and is again heard at night till the
last trace of twilight has disappeared. Mr. Allen also states, in a letter,
that this bird was “tolerably common along the streams near Fort Hays, but
very retiring, singing mostly after nightfall and before sunrise, during the
morning twilight. When singing, it had the habit of rising into the air. I
shot three one morning thus singing, when it was so dark I could not find
the birds. The one I obtained does not differ appreciably from specimens
from Mr. Cassin’s collection, labelled by him <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Peucæa cassini</i>, collected in
Texas.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway regards this record of the manners of this bird, while singing,
as indicating a specific difference from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. æstivalis</i>. The latter, in
Southern Illinois, has never been heard by him to sing at night, or in the
morning, nor even on the wing; but in broad midday, in the hottest days of
June, July, and August, he often heard them singing vigorously and sweetly,
as they perched upon a fence or a dead tree in a field, exactly after the manner
of our common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spizella pusilla</i>.</p>

<p>Among Dr. Heermann’s notes, quoted by Mr. Dresser, is one containing
the statement that he found this species not rare on the prairies near the
Medina River, in Texas, where it breeds. Mr. Dresser also states that when
at Howard’s Ranche, early in May, he found this bird by no means uncommon.
He confirms Dr. Heermann’s account, that it is easily distinguished as
it rises in the air, from a bush, with a peculiar fluttering motion of the wings,
at the same time singing, and then suddenly dropping into the bushes again.
<!--057.png--><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>
He adds that, in his absence, Dr. Heermann procured the eggs of this species
on the Medina, and while he was himself travelling in July towards Loredo,
he found a nest which he was fully confident belonged to this bird. It was
placed in a low bush not above a foot from the ground, and in its construction
resembled that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Poospiza bilineata</i>. The eggs were three in number,
pure white, closely agreeing with those taken by Dr. Heermann, and
larger and more elongated than those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bilineata</i>.</p>

<p>An egg of this species, taken in Texas by Dr. H. R. Storer, the identification
of which, however, was incomplete, is more oblong than the eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.

<p>This plainly colored species has the bill rather slender; tail rather long,
and considerably rounded; the outer feathers .40 of an inch shorter than
the middle; the feathers soft, and rounded at the tip. The wing is short;
the primaries not much longer than the tertials; the second, third, fourth,
and fifth nearly equal; the first scarcely longer than the secondaries.</p>

<p>There is a blackish tinge on the forehead, separated by a short central
line of white, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spizella socialis</i>. The eyelids are whitish, and there is a
short black line immediately over the upper lid. There is a faint chestnut
streak back of the eye. The chestnut of the nape is somewhat interrupted
by pale edgings. The blotches on the back melt almost insensibly into the
colors of the margins of the feathers. The outer edges of the secondaries
and tertials, and the outer surface of the tail, are yellowish-rusty.</p>

<p>This bird is similar in general appearance to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. æstivalis</i>, but has the
head above more continuous chestnut; the black cheek-stripe more distinct,
and the edge of wing whitish, not yellow, the bill more slender. A Mexican
specimen has a stouter bill.</p>

Mexico, is exceedingly similar, it being very difficult to present the differences
<!--058.png--><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span>
in a diagnosis. This trouble is partly the result of the insufficient series at
our command, for there are such different combinations of colors, according
to the season, that it is almost impossible to select the average characters of
two definable forms.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species was first described, in 1852, by Mr. Cassin, from a
specimen obtained in California by Dr. Heermann. Very little is known as
to its history, and it appears to have been generally overlooked by naturalists
who have studied the ornithology of that State. The extent of its distribution
or of its numbers remains unknown,&mdash;a circumstance due undoubtedly
to the nature of the country which it frequents.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann states that in the fall of 1851 he shot on the Cosumnes
River a single specimen of this bird from among a large flock of Sparrows
of various kinds. In the spring of the following year, among the mountains,
near the Calaveras River, he found it quite abundant. It was then flying in
pairs, engaged in picking grass-seed from the ground, and when started it
never extended its flight beyond a few yards. Its notes, in their character,
reminded him of the ditty of our common little Chipping Sparrow (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spizella
socialis</i>). He obtained several specimens. Its flight seemed feeble, and when
raised from the ground, from which it would not start until almost trodden
on, it would fly but a short distance, and almost immediately drop again into
the grass.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper has only met with this species on Catalina Island, in June,
where a few kept about the low bushes, feeding on the ground. They were
very difficult even to get a sight of. He heard them sing a few musical
notes, that reminded him of those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanospizæ</i>. They flew only a short
distance, and in their habits reminded him of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melospizæ</i>. Their favorite
places of resort he supposes to be pine woods, as in the eastern species.</p>

<p>The fact that this species has been found by Mr. Sumichrast to be a permanent
resident throughout all the temperate regions of Vera Cruz is a very
interesting one, and is suggestive of different manners and habits from those
supposed to belong to it as a bird allied with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ammodrami</i>. They are
abundant, and breed there, as in the United States, but nothing is given
throwing any positive light upon their general habits.</p>

nearly equal to the primaries; the secondaries a little shorter; the outer four primaries
much graduated, even the second shorter than any other quill. The tail is moderate,

the inner, being more than one third as wide. The upper parts are olive-green, the under
whitish.</p>

<p>The position of this genus is a matter of considerable uncertainty. On

<span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Fox-colored Sparrow, in its seasons of migrations, is a very
common bird throughout the United States east of the Mississippi River.
It has not been ascertained to breed in any part of the United States, though
it may do so in Northeastern Maine. Mr. Boardman has not met with it
near Calais, nor did I see nor could I hear of it in any part of Nova Scotia
or New Brunswick that I visited. In passing north, these birds begin their
northern movements in the middle of March, and from that time to the last
of April they are gradually approaching their summer quarters. Their first
appearance near Boston is about the 15th of March, and they linger in that
vicinity, or successive parties appear, until about the 20th of April. The last
comers are usually in song. On their return, the middle or last of October,
they pass rapidly, and usually make no stay. In Southwestern Texas these
birds were not observed by Mr. Dresser, nor in Arizona by Dr. Coues, but in
the Indian Territory Dr. Woodhouse found them very abundant on the
approach of winter. Dr. Coues speaks of them as common in South Carolina
from November to April, but less numerous than most of the Sparrows.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Washington this bird is found from October to April.
I have met with small groups of them through all the winter months among
the fallen leaves in retired corners of the Capitol grounds, where they were
busily engaged, in the manner of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilo</i>, in scratching in the earth for
their food. At those periods when the ground was open, their habits were
eminently similar to those of the gallinaceous birds. In March and April
they were in company with the White-throated Sparrows, but passed north
at least a month earlier.</p>

<p><!--064.png--><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span>
During their stay in the United States these birds keep in small distinctive
flocks, never mingling, though often in the same places, with other species.
They are found in the edges of thickets and in moist woods. They are usually
silent, and only occasionally utter a call-note, low and soft. In the
spring the male becomes quite musical, and is one of our sweetest and most
remarkable singers. His voice is loud, clear, and melodious; his notes full,
rich, and varied; and his song is unequalled by any of this family that I have
ever heard. They soon become reconciled to confinement and quite tame,
and sing a good part of the year if care is taken in regard to their food. If
allowed to eat to excess, they become very fat and heavy, and lose their song.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues did not meet with these birds in Labrador, but Mr. Audubon
found them there and in Newfoundland in large numbers; and, according
to the observations of Sir John Richardson, they breed in the wooded districts
of the fur countries, up to the 68th parallel of latitude.</p>

<p>These birds were also found abundantly at Fort Simpson and Great Slave
Lake by Mr. Robert Kennicott and Mr. B. R. Ross; at Fort Anderson, Anderson
River, Swan River, and in various journeys, by Mr. R. MacFarlane;
at Fort Resolution, Fort Good Hope, La Pierre House, and Fort Yukon, by
Mr. Lockhart; at Peel’s River, by Mr. J. Flett; at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s, by Mr.
H. M. Bannister; and at Nulato, by Mr. W. H. Dall. They were observed at
Fort Simpson as early as May 17, and by Mr. Kennicott as late as September
17. Mr. Dall states that at Nulato he found this Sparrow in abundance. It
arrived there from the 10th to the 15th of May. It breeds there, and its
eggs were obtained on the Yukon River. In the month of August in 1867
and of July in 1868 it was abundant at the mouth of the Yukon and at
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s. One was also shot at Unalaklik. The birds seemed to prefer
thickets to the more open country. Mr. Bannister did not find it abundant.
He shot only one specimen during the season, in an alder thicket
near the fort; and Mr. Pease, who was familiar with the species, only saw a
single individual.</p>

<p>According to the reports of both Mr. MacFarlane and Mr. Kennicott, the
nest of this species was found both on the ground and in trees. In one
instance it was in a tree about eight feet from the ground, and in its
structure was said to be similar to the nests of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus aliciæ</i>. They were
nearly all found after the middle of June, a few as early as the 7th. One
was found on the ground at the foot of a tuft of dwarf willows, which helped
to conceal it from view. This was composed of coarse hay, lined with
some of a finer quality, a few deer-hairs, and a small quantity of fresh and
growing moss, intermingled together. In speaking of this nest Mr. MacFarlane
states that all the nests of this Sparrow he had previously met
with had been built in the midst of branches of pine or spruce trees, and
had been similar to those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. aliciæ</i>, which, in this instance, it did
not resemble. He adds that this species, though not numerous, extended
quite to the borders of the wooded country, to the north and northwest of
<!--065.png--><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>
Fort Anderson. Afterwards he observed several other nests on the ground,
all of which were similar to the last, and it is by no means impossible
that in certain instances these birds may have occupied old nests of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. aliciæ</i>, and used them for purposes of incubation. Richardson states that
its nests are constructed in a low bush, and are made of dry grass, hair, and
feathers. He states that the eggs are five in number, of a pale mountain-green
tint, and marbled with irregular spots of brown.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon, who found several of the nests of this bird in Labrador,
near the coast, describes them as large for the size of the bird, and as usually
placed on the ground among moss or tall grass near the stem of a creeping
fir, the branches of which usually conceal it from view. Its exterior is
loosely formed of dry grasses and moss, with a carefully disposed inner layer
of fine grasses, circularly arranged. The lining consists of very delicate
fibrous roots, with feathers of different kinds of water-fowl. In one instance
he noted the down of the eider-duck. He found their eggs from the middle
of June to the 5th of July. When their nest was approached, the female
affected lameness, and employed all the usual arts to decoy the intruder
away. They raised but one brood in a season, and about the first of September
left Labrador for the south in small flocks, made up of members of one
family.</p>

<p>Their eggs measure from .92 to an inch in length, and .70 in breadth.
They are oblong in shape. Their ground-color is a light bluish-white,
thickly spotted with a rusty-brown, often so fully as to conceal the
ground.</p>

<p>This species differs a good deal in form from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. iliaca</i>. The claws are
much larger and stouter, the wing
a good deal shorter and more
rounded. The differences in color
are very appreciable, the tints being
dark sepia-brown instead of red,
and perfectly uniform above, not
spotted; the under parts much
more thickly spotted.</p>

<p>Specimens from Alaska show a
tendency to longer and perhaps
more slender bills. Some are
rather more rufous-brown than the
type; others have a faint tinge of ashy anteriorly, although scarcely appreciable.
This is especially noticeable in some skins from Fort Tejon,
they being almost exactly intermediate between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">townsendi</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">schistacea</i>, or
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">megarhynchus</i>.</p>

<p>Young birds are not materially different from the adult, except in having
the white of under parts replaced by pale rusty; the back is rather duller
in color, but without spots or stripes of any kind.</p>

<p><abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 46,620 from British Columbia has the bill much stouter than in the
average.</p>

<p>It is by no means certain, however probable, that this bird is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. unalaschkensis</i>
of Gmelin, an important objection being its absence so far in
collections received by the Smithsonian Institution from that island. We
therefore leave the question open for the present.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The history of this western analogue of the Fox-colored Sparrow
is still quite imperfectly known. It was first obtained in Oregon by
Mr. Townsend, on the 15th of February. He describes it as a very active
and a very shy bird, keeping constantly among the low bushes of wormwood,
and on the ground in their vicinity. It was partially gregarious, six
or eight being usually seen together. Its call-note was a short, sharp, quick
chirp, and it also had occasionally a low weak warble.</p>

<p>Dr. Gambel, referring probably to its occurrence in winter in California,
speaks of this bird as an abundant resident in that State, which is not correct,
it being only a winter visitant, and not abundant south of San Francisco.
He describes its habits as very different from those of any other Sparrow,
and more like those of a Thrush. It is said to keep in retired bushy places,
or in underwood, and was scarcely ever seen except on the ground, and then
would scarcely ever be discovered but for the noise it made in scratching
among the leaves. It was silent and unsuspicious, and he rarely heard it
utter even its occasional chirp.</p>

<p><!--067.png--><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span>
Dr. Cooper states that he found this Sparrow only a winter resident in
Washington Territory, where, in company with other Sparrows, it kept constantly
on the ground, frequenting the thickets and scratching among the
fallen leaves for its food. It was most common in the interior, but in very
cold weather sought the coast, in company with the Snowbird and other
species. He observed a few lingering about the Straits of Fuca until April.
After that he saw no more of them until their return southward in October.
During their winter residence Dr. Cooper never heard them sing. Dr. Suckley
found them rather abundant near Fort Steilacoom, though not so common
as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melospiza rufina</i>, which they greatly resembled in habits and in general
appearance.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann describes them as abundant and migratory in California,
visiting that State only in winter. He speaks of them as of a solitary and
quiet nature, resorting to the thickets and underwood for its food, turning
over the leaves and scratching up the ground in the manner of the Brown
Thrush, occasionally hopping backwards as if to ascertain the results of its
labors.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper, in his Report on the Birds of California, reaffirms that this
bird is only a winter visitant to the lower country near the Columbia, but
also conjectures that it spends the summer in the Cascade Mountains, between
April and October. Specimens have been obtained near San Francisco
in winter. It seemed to him to be both a shy and a silent bird, frequenting
only woods or thick bushes, and while there constantly scratching
among the fallen leaves, and feeding both on seeds and insects. He has
seen either this bird or the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. megarhynchus</i> as far south as San Diego in
winter. He has also noticed its arrival near San Francisco as early as October
20.</p>

<p>On the Spokan Plains, in British Columbia, Mr. J. K. Lord first met with
this species. They were there not uncommon in dark swampy places east
of the Cascades. These birds he found remarkable for their singular habit
of scratching dead leaves or decayed material of any sort with their feet,
exactly as do barn-door fowls,&mdash;sending the dirt right, left, and behind. It
picks up seeds, insects, larvæ, or anything eatable that it thus digs out, and
then proceeds to scratch for more. The long and unusually strong claws with
which this bird is provided seem particularly well adapted for these habits,
so unusual in a Sparrow. At almost any time, by waiting a few moments,
one may be pretty sure to hear the scratching of several of these birds from
under the tangle of fallen timber.</p>

<p>Several specimens were obtained in Sitka by Bischoff and others, but
without any record of their habits.</p>

the upper surface of wings, tail-feathers,

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Head-waters of Platte and middle region of United States to Fort Tejon and to
Fort Crook, California.</p>

<p>This species is readily distinguished from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. iliaca</i> by the slaty back and
spots on the breast, the absence of streaks above, and the longer claws. From
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">townsendi</i> it differs in having the head, back, sides, and spots beneath slate-colored,
instead of dark reddish-brown. The spotting beneath is much more
sparse, the spots smaller, more triangular, and confined to the terminal
portion of the feathers, instead of frequently involving the entire outer edge.
The axillars are paler. The wings and tail are the same in both species.</p>

<p>The young bird is quite similar; but the spots beneath are badly defined,
more numerous, and longitudinal rather than triangular.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt, however, that this bird is a geographical race
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. townsendi</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> For all that we know in regard to the habits and general distribution
of this species, we are indebted to the observations of Mr. Ridgway,
who met with it while accompanying Mr. Clarence King’s geological survey.
It was first obtained in July, 1856, by Lieutenant F. T. Bryan, on the Platte
River, and others were afterwards collected at Fort Tejon by Mr. Xantus.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway found the Slate-colored Sparrow at Carson City, during its
spring migrations northward, in the early part of March. At this time it
was seen only among the willows along the Carson River, and was by no
means common. It had the habit of scratching among the dead leaves, on
the ground in the thickets, precisely after the manner of the eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. iliaca</i>.
In the following September he again found it among the thickets in the
Upper Humboldt Valley. In Parley’s Park, among the Wahsatch Mountains,
he found it a very plentiful species in June, nesting among the willows
and other shrubbery along the streams. There it was always found in
company with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. fallax</i>, which in song it greatly resembles, though its
other notes are quite distinct, the ordinary one being a sharp <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chuck</i>. The
<!--069.png--><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span>
nest of the two species, he adds, were also so much alike in manner of construction
and situation, and the eggs so similar, that it required a careful
observation to identify a nest when one was found.</p>

<p>The eggs from one nest of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerella schistacea</i> measure .90 by .70 of
an inch, have a ground of a light mountain-green, and are profusely spotted
with blotches of a rufous-brown, generally diffused over the entire egg.</p>

<p>Another nest of this species, obtained in Parley’s Park, in the Wahsatch
Mountains, by Mr. Ridgway, June 23, 1869, was built in a clump of willows,
about two feet from the ground. The nest is two inches in height, two and
a half in diameter, cavity one and a half deep, with a diameter of two. It
is composed externally of coarse decayed water-grass, is lined with fine hair
and finer material like the outside. The eggs, four in number, are .80 by .67
of an inch, of a very rounded oval shape, the ground-color of a pale green,
blotched and marked chiefly at the larger end with brown spots of a wine-colored
hue.</p>

Sierra Nevada, from Fort Tejon north
to 40<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> latitude (Carson City, Nevada, breeding,
<span class="sc">Ridgway</span>).</p>

<p>This very remarkable variety of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. townsendi</i>
is quite local in its distribution,
having been observed only in the Sierra Nevada region, as above
indicated. The first specimens were brought from Fort Tejon by Mr. J.
Xantus, but at what season they were found there is not indicated on the
labels. Recently, specimens were procured by Mr. Ridgway at Carson City,
<abbr title="Nevada">Nev.</abbr>, in April, they having arrived there about the 20th of April, frequenting
the ravines of the Sierra near the snow. At the same place the
<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">schistacea</i> was found earlier in the spring, but among the willows along
the streams in the valleys, and not met with in the mountains; and all the
individuals had passed northward before those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">megarhynchus</i> arrived.</p>

<p><!--070.png--><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span>
In this restricted distribution the present bird is a companion of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melospiza melodia</i>, <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">heermanni</i>, and the characteristics of form are the
same in both as compared with their Middle Province and Northern representatives;
while they both differ from the latter (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">townsendi</i> of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerella</i>, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rufina</i> of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melospiza</i>) in purer, lighter, and less brown colors.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Dr. Cooper met with several individuals of this bird towards the
summits of the Sierra Nevada, in September, 1863, but was unable to preserve
any of them. So far as he was able to observe them, they had no song, and
their habits were generally similar to those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. townsendi</i>.</p>

<p>The Thick-billed Sparrow was found by Mr. Ridgway as a very common
bird among the alder swamps in the ravines of the eastern slope of the Sierra
Nevada during the summer. Near Carson City, April 25, in a swampy
thicket near the streams in the level slopes, he heard, for the first time, its
beautiful song, and killed a specimen in the midst of its utterance of what,
he adds, was one of the most exquisitely rich utterances he ever heard.
This song, he states, resembles, in richness and volume, that of the Louisiana
Water Thrush (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Seiurus ludovicianus</i>), qualities in which that bird is
hardly equalled by any other North American bird. They were singing
in all parts of that swampy thicket, and up the ravines as far as the snow.
From the nature of the place and the character of their song, they were
at first supposed to be the Water Thrush, until specimens of these exquisite
songsters were secured. He regards this bird as second to none of
our singers belonging to this family and though in variety, sprightliness,
and continuity, and also in passionate emotional character, its song is not
equal to that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chondestes grammaca</i>, yet it is far superior in power and
richness of tone. Mr. Ridgway regards this bird as easily distinguishable
from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. schistacea</i>, of which, however, it is only a variety. There is a
total discrepancy in its notes, and while neither species is resident in the
latitude of Carson City, through which both kinds pass in their migrations,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. schistacea</i> lingers in the spring only a short time, soon passing to the
northward, while the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. megarhynchus</i> arrives later and remains through the
summer. The former makes its temporary abode among the willows along
the river, while the latter breeds in the shrubbery of the mountain ravines.</p>

blue, red, or black and white; except in one or two instances the sexes very different in
color.</p>

The preceding diagnosis is intended to embrace the brightly colored
passerine birds of North America, different in general appearance from the
common Sparrows. It is difficult to draw the line with perfect strictness, so
as to separate the species from those of the preceding group, but the bill is
always more curved, as well as larger, and the colors are brighter. They resemble
quite closely, at a superficial glance, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coccothraustinæ</i>, but may
be readily distinguished by absence of the projecting tufts surrounding the
base of the upper mandible, shorter, more rounded wings, and longer tarsi.</p>

<p>The genera may be most conveniently arranged as follows:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="indent1"><b class="primary-subset">A.</b> Wings decidedly longer than the tail. Eggs plain blue or white, unspotted.</p>

<p class="indent3"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calamospiza.</b> Bill moderate, the commissure with a deep angle
posteriorly and prominent lobe behind it; anteriorly nearly straight;
commissure of lower mandible with a prominent angle. Outer toe longer
than the inner, both nearly as long as the posterior. Outer four primaries
about equal, and abruptly longer than the rest. Tertials nearly equal
to primaries. Tail-feathers broad at tips. Color: black with white spot
on wing in <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, brownish streaks in

plain pale blue.</p>

<p class="indent3"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Euspiza.</b> Bill weaker, the commissure with a more shallow angle,
and much less prominent sinuation behind it; anteriorly distinctly

posterior one. First primary longest, the rest successively shorter.
Tertials but little longer than secondaries. Tail-feathers attenuated at
tips. Color: back brown streaked with black; throat white; jugulum
yellow or ashy; with or without black spot on fore neck. A yellow
or white superciliary stripe. Nest on or near ground; eggs plain pale

This genus is well characterized by the large swollen bill, with its curved
culmen; the large strong feet and claws; the long wings, a little longer
than the tail, and with the tertials
as long as the primaries;
the first four quills about equal,
and abruptly longest; the tail
short and graduated.</p>

<p>The only group of North
American <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spizellinæ</i>, with the
tertials equal to the primaries in
the closed wing, is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerculus</i>.
This, however, has a differently
formed bill, weaker feet, the
inner primaries longer and more regularly graduated, the tail-feathers more
acute and shorter, and the plumage streaked brownish and white instead of
black.</p>

High Central Plains to the Rocky Mountains; southwesterly to Valley of

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This peculiar species, known by some writers as the Lark Bunting,
and by others as the White-winged Blackbird, was first described by
Townsend in 1837. He met with it when, in company with Mr. Nuttall, he
made his western tour across the continent, on the 24th of May, soon after
crossing the north branch of the Platte River. The latter writer regarded it
<!--076.png--><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 62]</span>
as closely allied to the Bobolink, and described it as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dolichonyx</i>. He
describes the birds as gregarious, consorting with the Cowbirds, and, at the
time he met with them, uttering most delightful songs. Towards evening
they sometimes saw these birds in all directions around them, on the hilly
grounds, rising at intervals to some height, hovering and flapping their wings,
and, at the same time, giving forth a song which Mr. Nuttall describes as
being something like <i class="birdcall">weet-weet-wt-wt-wt</i>, notes that were between the hurried
warble of the Bobolink and the melody of a Skylark. It is, he says, one
of the sweetest songsters of the prairies, is tame and unsuspicious, and the
whole employment of the little band seemed to be an ardent emulation of
song.</p>

<p>It feeds on the ground, and, as stated by Mr. Townsend, may be seen in
flocks of from sixty to a hundred together. It was, so far as their observations
went, found inhabiting exclusively the wide grassy plains of the Platte.
They did not see it to the west of the Black Hills, or the first range of the
Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>To Mr. Nuttall’s account Mr. Townsend adds that this bird is strictly gregarious,
that it feeds on the ground, around which it runs in the manner of the
Grass Finch, to which, in its habits, it seems to be somewhat allied. Mr.
Townsend adds that, as their caravan moved along, large flocks of these birds,
sometimes to the number of sixty or a hundred individuals, were started
from the ground, and the piebald appearance of the males and females promiscuously
intermingled presented a very striking and by no means unpleasing
effect. While the flock was engaged in feeding, some of the males were
observed to rise suddenly to considerable height in the air, and, poising
themselves over their companions with their wings in constant and rapid
motion, continued nearly stationary. In this situation they poured forth a
number of very lively and sweetly modulated notes, and, at the expiration
of about a minute, descended to the ground and moved about as before.
Mr. Townsend also states that he met with none of these birds west of the
Black Hills.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway also mentions that though he found these birds very abundant
on the plains east of the Black Hills, he met with only a single specimen
to the westward of that range. This was at Parley’s Park, among the
Wahsatch Mountains.</p>

<p>Dr. Gambel, in his paper on the Birds of California, states that he met
with small flocks of this handsome species in the bushy plains, and along the
margins of streams, during the winter months. And Dr. Heermann states
that he also found this species numerous in California, New Mexico, and
Texas. Arriving in the last-named State in May, he found this species there
already mated, and about to commence the duties of incubation.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser found these birds common near San Antonio during the winter.
In December he noticed several flocks near Eagle Pass. They frequented
the roads, seeking the horse-dung. They were quite shy, and when disturbed

the whole flock would go off together, uttering a low and melodious whistle.
In May and June several were still about near Howard’s Rancho, and on his
return from Houston, in June, he succeeded in shooting one in its full summer
plumage, when its specific name is peculiarly appropriate. He does not,
however, think that, as a general thing, any of them remain about San Antonio
to breed.</p>

<p>They breed in great numbers on the plains of Wyoming Territory, and
probably also in Colorado, Montana, and Dakota. The Smithsonian collection
embraces specimens obtained in July from the Yellowstone, from Platte
River, Pole Creek, the Black Hills, and Bridger’s Pass, indicating that they
breed in these localities; also specimens from Texas, New Mexico, Sonora,
and Espia, in Mexico, but none from California.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly, who met with these birds both in Sonora and at Espia, on
the Mexican Boundary Survey, states that he observed them in the valley
of the river early in the morning, in very large flocks. During the greater
part of the day they feed on the hills among the bushes. When on the wing
they keep very close together, so that a single discharge of shot would sometimes
bring down twenty or thirty. Mr. J. H. Clark, on the same survey,
also states that he sometimes found them occurring in flocks of hundreds.
The greatest numbers were seen near Presidio del Norte. Great varieties of
plumage were observed in the same flock. The food seemed to be seeds
almost exclusively. They were very simultaneous in all their movements.
Stragglers were never observed remaining behind after the flock had started.
They are, he states, the most absolutely gregarious birds he has ever met
with.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues, who regarded this bird as one highly characteristic of the prairie
fauna, writes me that he met with it in great numbers in Kansas, soon
after leaving Fort Riley, and saw it every day until he reached the Raton
Mountains in New Mexico. “For two or three days, in fact, from Fort
Larned to the mountains,” he writes, “I scarcely saw anything else. This
was the first week in June, and most of the birds seemed to be paired and
nesting, though occasionally a dozen or more were seen together, flocking
like the Blackbirds that they strongly recall. They were in full song, and
proved delightful vocalists. Sometimes they warble from some spray or low
bush offering a stand a little above the level flower-beds of the prairie, but
oftener they mount straight up, hovering high in the air on tremulous wings,
pouring forth their melodious strains until, seemingly exhausted, they sink
back to the ground. At such times it is interesting to watch two rival males,
each straining every nerve to mount higher than the other, and sing more
acceptably to its mate hidden in the verdure below. This habit of rising on
the wing to sing, so famed in the case of the Skylark, seems not confined to
particular species, but to be a forced practice of a number of different birds
residing in open level regions, that do not afford the elevated perches usually
chosen by woodland songsters for their performances. The ordinary flight
<!--078.png--><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span>
of this species is altogether of a different character, being a low gliding motion,
overtopping the weeds and bushes. That the birds were nesting at this
time is rendered still more probable by the fact that the males noticed as we
passed along were out of all proportion, in numbers, to the females seen.
They were very heedless of approach, and any number could have been
readily destroyed. I never saw any at Fort Whipple, or elsewhere in Arizona,
though Dr. Heermann says that they are abundant in the southern
portions of the Territory, and specimens are recorded from Lower California.”</p>

<p>Mr. Allen found the Lark Bunting one of the few birds that seemed
strictly confined to the arid plains near Fort Hays, in Kansas. He met with
it in great abundance, but only on the high ridges and dry plateaus, where
they seemed to live in colonies. He describes them as very wary, and very
tenacious of life, often flying long distances, even after having been mortally
wounded. They seemed to delight to fly in strong winds, when most other
birds kept in shelter. They sing while on the wing, hovering in the wind
and shaking the tail and legs after the well-known manner of the Yellow-breasted
Chat. Its song seemed to him to strongly resemble that of the
Chat, with which, at such times, its whole demeanor strikingly accorded.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann, in his Report on the birds collected in the survey on the
<abbr title="thirty-second">32d</abbr> parallel, states that he first observed these birds on approaching the
Pimos villages. They were associated with large flocks of Sparrows, gleaning
grain and grass-seed upon the ground. When started up they flew but
a short distance before they resumed their occupation. After crossing the
San Pedro he again found them in large flocks. At Fort Fillmore, in Mesilla
Valley, it was also quite common and associated with the Cowbird and
Blackbird, searching for grain among the stable offals. He again met with
them in Texas, in the month of April, most of them still retaining their
winter coat. He describes the tremulous fluttering motion of the wings with
which the male accompanies its song while on the wing as very much after
the manner of the Bobolink, and he speaks of their song as a disconnected
but not an unmusical chant. He found their nests on the ground, made of
fine grasses, lined with hair, and in one instance he found the eggs spotted
with faint red dashes.</p>

<p>At Gilmer, in Wyoming Territory, their nests were found by Mr. Durkee
built on the ground, and composed of dry grasses very loosely arranged.
The eggs, four or five in number, are of a uniform and beautiful light shade
of blue, similar to those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Euspiza americana</i>. They measure .90 by
.70 of an inch, are of a rounded-oval shape, and, so far as I have observed,
are entirely unspotted, although eggs with a few reddish blotches are said to
have been met with.</p>

<p>Among adult males, scarcely two individuals exactly alike can be found.
In some the black of the throat is continued in blotches down the middle

of habitat, for specimens from remote regions from each other may be found
as nearly alike as any from the same locality. Some specimens from Central
America are more deeply colored than North American ones, owing, no
doubt, to the freshness of the plumage.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The history of the Black-throated Bunting has, until very recently,
been much obscured by incorrect
observations and wrong descriptions. Evidently
this bird has been more or less confounded
with one or two other species entirely
different from it. Thus Wilson, Audubon,
and Nuttall, in speaking of its nest and eggs,
give descriptions applicable to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coturniculus
passerinus</i> or to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. henslowi</i>, but which are
wholly wrong as applied to those of this
bird. Nuttall, whose observations of North
American birds were largely made in Massachusetts,
speaks of this bird being quite common
in that State, where it is certainly very
rare, and describes, as its song, notes that
have no resemblance to those of this Bunting,
but which are a very exact description of the musical performances of
the Yellow-winged Sparrow.</p>

<p>It is found in the eastern portion of North America, from the base of the
Black Hills to the Atlantic States, and from Massachusetts to South Carolina.
I am not aware that on the Atlantic it has ever been traced farther south
than that State, but farther west it is found as far at least as Southwestern
Texas. During winter it is found in Central America, and in Colombia,
South America.</p>

<p><!--081.png--><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span>
In Massachusetts it is extremely rare. Mr. Hopkins found it breeding in
Williamstown, and sent me its eggs. I have also met with its nest and eggs,
in a low meadow near the sea, in Hingham. In both of these instances the
nest was on the ground. A specimen was shot in Newton by Mr. John Thaxter,
June 26, 1857, that had all the appearance of being then in the process
of incubation. Throughout Pennsylvania, and in the vicinity of Washington,
these birds are quite common.</p>

<p>Wilson states that they are very common in the vicinity of Philadelphia,
where they make their appearance in the middle of May, and where they
seem to prefer level fields covered with rye-grass, clover, or timothy. They
are described as more conspicuous for the quantity than for the quality of
their song. This consists of three notes, sounding like <i class="birdcall">chip-chip-chē-chē-chē</i>.
Of this unmusical ditty they are by no means parsimonious, and for nearly
three months after their first arrival, every level field of grain or grass resounds
with their quaint serenade. In their shape and manners, Wilson
states, they bear a close resemblance to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Emberiza citrinella</i> of Europe.
They become silent by September, and in the course of that month depart
for the southwest. It is a rare bird in South Carolina, but is very abundant
in Texas, where it is also resident, and undoubtedly breeds. Audubon states
that he was surprised to see how numerous they were in every open piece of
ground throughout that State, especially those covered with tufts of grass.
They are, he states, not so common in Ohio, and quite rare in Kentucky.
They are especially abundant in the open lands of Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin,
Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska; and they have been found breeding
as far to the west as Wyoming Territory, near to the base of the eastern
range of the Rocky Mountains. Mr. Allen found this species one of the
most abundant birds of Western Iowa, characterizing it as eminently a prairie
species, and one of the few inhabitants of the wide open stretches.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser found, early in May, numbers of these birds in the mesquite
thickets near the San Antonio and Medina Rivers, and, as he found them
equally numerous there in July, he naturally infers that they breed in that
neighborhood. Dr. Heermann obtained some eggs which he had no doubt
belonged to this species, though he was unable to secure the parent.</p>

<p>It has also been found in Western Texas and in the Indian Territory by
Mr. J. H. Clark, in Texas by Dr. Lincecum, at the Kiowa agency by Dr.
Palmer, and on the Yellowstone by Dr. Hayden.</p>

<p>This bird is not gregarious, always moving in pairs, and although, as they
are preparing for their migrations, they congregate in particular localities,
they always keep somewhat apart in family groups, and do not mingle promiscuously
as do many others of this family. They are, at all times, unsuspicious
and easily approached, and when fired at will often return to the
same field from which they were startled. They are very partial to certain
localities, and are rarely to be met with in sandy regions.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon states that the notes of this species very closely resemble
<!--082.png--><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span>
those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Emberiza miliaria</i> of Europe. Its unmusical notes are almost
continuously repeated from sunrise to sunset. When the female is startled
from her nest she creeps quietly away through the grass, and then hides herself,
making no complaint, and not showing herself even if her treasures are
taken from her. Their nests are constructed of coarse grasses and stems,
lined with finer and similar materials. They are, in certain localities, placed
on the ground, but more frequently, in many parts of the country, they are
built in positions above the ground. This is almost invariably the case
where they nest among the tall coarse grasses of the prairies. My attention
was first called to this peculiarity by Dr. J. W. Velie, then of Rock
Island, <abbr title="Illinois">Ill.</abbr> He informed me that in no instance had he found the nest of
this species on the ground, but always raised a few inches above it. It was
usually constructed of the tops of the red-top grasses, worked in among a
bunch of thick grass, so as to make the nest quite firm. The meadows in
which Dr. Velie found these nests were quite dry, so that there was no necessity
for their thus building clear from the ground in order to escape being
wet. I was afterwards informed by the late Mr. Robert Kennicott that his
experience in regard to the nests of these birds had been invariably the
same. Dr. P. R. Hoy, of Racine, is confident that these birds in Wisconsin
never nest on the ground, or else very rarely, as he has never noticed their
doing so. He writes that during one season he visited and made notes of
nineteen different nests. Ten of these were built in gooseberry-bushes, four
on thorn-bushes, three among blackberry-brambles, one on a raspberry-bush,
and one on a wild rose. None were within a foot of the ground, and some
were six feet from it. They have two broods in a season.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mr. Ridgway informs me that in Southern Illinois the
nest of this species is always placed on the ground, usually in a meadow, and
that he has never found its nest placed anywhere else than on the ground, in
a tuft of grass or clover. Professor Baird has had a similar experience in
Pennsylvania. Mr. B. F. Goss found them nesting both in bushes and on
the ground at Neosho Falls, Kansas.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are of a uniform light blue color, similar in shade
to the eggs of the common Bluebird, as also to those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calamospiza bicolor</i>.
They vary considerably in size, the smallest measuring .80 of an inch
in length by .60 in breadth, while the larger and more common size is .90 by
.70 of an inch.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Rose-breasted Grosbeak, during the summer months, appears
to have a widely extended area of distribution,
though nowhere a very abundant
species, and one of somewhat irregular
occurrence. It is found as far to the east
as Nova Scotia, to the north as Selkirk
Settlement and the valley of the Saskatchewan,
and to the west as Nebraska.
It winters in great numbers in Guatemala.
In the last-named country, while
abundant in the Vera Paz, it was not
found at Dueñas, but was a common
cage-bird in the city of Guatemala. It
was also found common at Herradura, in Colombia, South America, by Mr.
C. W. Wyatt.</p>

<p>This bird was noticed on a single occasion near San Antonio by Mr.
Dresser, but was not observed by Dr. Woodhouse in Texas, or in the Indian
Territory. Sumichrast did not meet with it in Vera Cruz. At <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephens,
<abbr title="New Brunswick">N. B.</abbr>, Mr. Boardman found this species a regular summer visitant, but rare,
nor did Mr. Verrill find it common in the western part of Maine. In Massachusetts
this bird becomes more common, but is nowhere very abundant.
It has been met with in various places in the eastern part of the
State, but rarely, and only in restricted localities. In the western part of the
State it is more numerous, as well as throughout the whole of the Connecticut
Valley. At Springfield, Mr. Allen notes it as a summer visitant, breeding
in the open woods, but not abundant. He is of the opinion that
during the past twenty-five years this bird has increased in numbers in all
parts of the State. Mr. Allen found this bird quite common in Southern
Indiana, in Northern Illinois, and in Western Iowa, where he found it frequent
in the groves along the streams. Dr. Coues mentions it as rare and
only migratory in South Carolina. Mr. McIlwraith gives it as a summer
resident in the vicinity of Hamilton, Canada, where it is very generally distributed
throughout the open woods, arriving there the second week in May.
It is also found throughout Vermont, in favorable situations in open woods,
on the borders of streams. It is not uncommon in the vicinity of Randolph,
where it regularly breeds.</p>

<p>Wilson, who enjoyed but few opportunities of studying the habits of this
species, states that it eagerly feeds on the ripe fruit of the sour gum-tree.
He was also aware of its fine song, its value as a caged bird, and that it
frequently sings during the night.</p>

<p><!--086.png--><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 72]</span>
Sir John Richardson met with a single specimen of this bird near the
Saskatchewan during his first expedition with Sir John Franklin, but did not
afterwards meet with it. He states that it frequents the deep recesses of
the forests, and there sings a clear, mellow, and harmonious song.</p>

<p>Nuttall appears to have seen little or nothing of this bird, except in confinement.
He describes it as thriving very well in a cage, and as a melodious
and indefatigable warbler, frequently passing the greater part of the night in
singing, with great variety of tones. It is said, while thus earnestly engaged,
to mount on tiptoe, as if seemingly in an ecstasy of enthusiasm and delight
at the unrivalled harmony of its own voice. These notes, he adds, are
wholly warbled, now loud and clear, now with a querulous and now with a
sprightly air, and finally lower and more pathetic. In Mr. Nuttall’s opinion
it has no superior in song, except the Mocking-Bird.</p>

<p>Mr. Say met with these birds in the spring, on the banks of the Missouri,
and afterwards, on the 5th of August, at Pembina in the 49th degree of
latitude.</p>

<p>This bird arrives in Eastern Massachusetts about the 15th of May, and
leaves in September. It nests during the first week in June.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon states that he has frequently observed this species, early in
the month of March, in the lower parts of Louisiana, making its way eastward,
and has noticed the same circumstance both at Henderson, <abbr title="Kentucky">Ky.</abbr>, and at
Cincinnati, <abbr title="Ohio">O</abbr>. At this period it passes at a considerable height in the air.
He never saw it in the maritime parts of Georgia or Carolina, but they have
been procured in the mountainous parts of those States. On the banks of
the Schuylkill, early in May, he has observed this bird feeding on the tender
buds of the trees. When in Texas, in 1837, Mr. Audubon also found it very
abundant in April.</p>

<p>Dr. Bachman, quoted by Audubon, states that, having slightly wounded a
beautiful male of this species, he kept it three years in confinement. It very
soon became quite tame, fed, in an open room, on moistened bread. It was
at once reconciled to live in a cage, and fed readily on various kinds of food,
but preferred Indian meal and hemp-seed. It was also very fond of insects,
and ate grasshoppers and crickets with peculiar relish. It watched the
flies with great apparent interest, and often snatched at and secured the
wasps that ventured within its cage. During bright moonshiny nights it
sang sweetly, but not loudly, remaining in the same position on its perch.
When it sang in the daytime it was in the habit of vibrating its wings, in
the manner of the Mocking-Bird. It was a lively and a gentle companion
for three years, but suffered from cold in severe wintry weather, and finally
died from this cause. It would frequently escape from its cage, and never
exhibited the least desire to leave him, but always returned to the house at
night. It sang about eight weeks, and the rest of the year had only a faint

<p>This Grosbeak builds in low trees on the edge of woods, frequently in

small groves on the banks of streams. Their nests are coarsely built, with
a base composed of waste stubble, fragments of leaves, and stems of plants.
These are intermingled with and strengthened by twigs and coarser stems.
They have a diameter of eight inches, and a height of three and a half.
The upper portion of the nest is usually composed of dry <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usnea</i> mosses,
mingled with a few twigs, and lined with finer twigs. Its cavity is three
inches in diameter and one in depth, being quite shallow for so large a nest.</p>

<p>The eggs bear some resemblance to those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyrangæ</i>, but are usually
much larger, though they vary greatly in size. Their ground-color is usually
a light but well-marked shade of verdigris-green, varying occasionally to a
greenish-white, and are marked, more or less, over their entire surface, with
blotches of reddish-brown. They vary in length from 1.05 to .90 of an inch,
and from .78 to .60.</p>

<p>During incubation, and in the presence of its mate, this Grosbeak is a
persistent and enthusiastic singer, and, at times, carries his love of song so
far as to betray his nest. This is more especially so when he relieves his
mate, takes her place on the nest, and then, apparently oblivious of the danger
of lifting up his voice in song when upon so responsible a duty, attracts,
by his melody, the oölogist to his treasures.</p>

<p>Dr. Hoy, of Racine, supplies some interesting information in regard to the
habits and nesting of this species. On the 15th of June, within six miles
of that city, he found seven nests, all within a space of not over five acres,
and he was assured that each year they resort to the same locality and nest
thus socially. Six of these nests were in thorn-trees, all were within six to
ten feet from the ground, and all were in the central portion of the top.
Three of the four parent birds sitting on the nests were males, and this he
was told was usually the case. When a nest was disturbed, all the neighboring
Grosbeaks gathered around and appeared equally interested. Both nest
and eggs so closely resemble those of the Tanagers that it is difficult to distinguish
them. Their position is, however, usually different, the Grosbeaks
generally nesting in the central portion of a small tree, the Tanagers’ being
placed on a horizontal limb.</p>

<p>This bird, in its range of habitat, appears to be represented by two varieties,
which, however, run into each other, so that it is often difficult to determine
to which variety specimens from intermediate regions should be
referred.</p>

<p>Taking the series from Eastern Mexico (Orizaba and Mirador) and northward
along the Rocky Mountains of the United States, we find the black of
the head continuous, sharply defined by a gently curved outline behind, and
without a trace of either the vertex or post-ocular stripes. This is the true
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melanocephalus</i>, as restricted, and may be regarded as the Rocky Mountain
form. The most western specimen is 11,241, from Fort Bridger; the most
northern (19,355), from Stinking River, Northern Wyoming. All specimens
from the Pacific coast eastward to the western base of the Rocky Mountains,
including Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas and Western Mexico south to Colima, differ from
the Rocky Mountain series in having the posterior outline of the black hood
ragged, and irregularly indented by the rufous of the nape, which always
extends in a quite broad stripe toward the eye, along the side of the occiput,
and quite frequently forms a conspicuous median vertex stripe, though the
latter feature is sometimes not distinct. These differences are observable
only in the males, and, although apparently slight, are yet sufficiently constant
to justify distinguishing them as races. The Rocky Mountain form
being the true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melanocephalus</i>, the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">capitalis</i> is proposed for the western
one.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This bird occurs from the high Central Plains to the Pacific,
and from the northern portions of Washington Territory to the table-lands
of Mexico. Mr. Ridgway found this species abundant, during the summer
months, in all the fertile wooded districts along the entire route of the
survey. At Sacramento it was common in the willow copses, and was observed
<!--091.png--><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span>
in the greatest numbers, in May, in the rich valley of the Truckee, in
company with Bullock’s Oriole, the Louisiana Tanager, and other species,
feeding upon the buds of the “grease-wood.” It principally inhabits the
willows along the rivers, and the shrubbery skirting the streams of the
mountain cañons. In its manners and notes Mr. Ridgway regards this
bird as an exact counterpart of the eastern species, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hedymeles ludovicianus</i>,
its song being by no means superior. The peculiar and very odd <i class="birdcall">click</i>
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludovicianus</i> is said to be equally characteristic of this bird. Mr.
Ridgway met with its nests in willows, about ten feet from the ground. He
had evidence that the male bird assists the female in the duties of incubation.</p>

<p>This bird, though a common summer resident in the Great Salt Lake Valley,
had all migrated, according to Mr. Allen, by the 1st of September. It
is well known there as the Peabird, from its fondness for green peas, of
which it is very destructive.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Cooper, this Grosbeak arrives in California, near San
Diego, about April 12. It is numerous during the summer throughout the
mountains both of the coast and of the Sierra Nevada, and extends its migrations
at least as far as Puget Sound. It is often kept in confinement
on account of its loud, sweet song. In the Coast Mountains, in May, its
music is said to be delightful, the males vying with each other from the tops
of the trees, and making the hills fairly ring with their melody.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found a nest of this bird, May 12, at the eastern base of the
Coast Range. It was built in a low horizontal branch of an alder, and consisted
of a few sticks and weeds, very loosely put together, with a lining of
grass and roots. The eggs, three in number, he describes as of a pale bluish-white
ground, thickly spotted with brown, more densely near the larger end.
Their size he gives as .95 by .70 of an inch.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper also states that they frequent the ground in search of food, but
also live much on trees, feeding on their buds. They are not gregarious,
assembling only in family groups in the fall. They do not fly high, nor do
they make any noise in flying.</p>

<p>He has observed these birds at Santa Cruz April 12, or as early as he saw
them at San Diego, three hundred and fifty miles farther south, and has
found a young bird fledged as early as May 23.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues speaks of this bird as an abundant summer resident of Arizona,
where it arrives by the first of May, and remains until the latter part of
September. He speaks of it as frequenting the thick brush of the ravines
and the cottonwood and willow copses of the river-bottoms. Its call-note
resembles that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lophortyx gambeli</i>. Its song, he says, is superb,&mdash;a
powerful, but melodious succession of clear, rich, rolling notes, reminding
one somewhat of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Icterus baltimore</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley speaks of this bird being sparingly found in the vicinity of
Fort Steilacoom, Puget Sound, where he obtained two specimens.</p>

<p><!--092.png--><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span>
Dr. Heermann speaks of the song of this bird as clear and musical, and as
very closely resembling that of our <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus migratorius</i>. He describes its
nests as formed with very little care, of twigs loosely thrown together, and
lined with roots, placed in the branches of bushes. The eggs, four in number,
he describes as of a greenish-blue ground, marked with irregular spots
of umber-brown, varying in intensity of shade.</p>

<p>The song of the western species is described by Mr. Nuttall as fully equal,
if not superior, to that of the Rose-breasted. He met with it on the central
table-lands of the Rocky Mountains, along the upper branches of the Colorado
River, where he found it frequenting the thick groves of the streams,
and where, throughout its dense forests, the powerful song and the inimitable
voice of this “most delightful Finch” cheered that naturalist amidst the
wildest desolation of that “forest primeval,” where this superb vocalist made
the woods echo and re-echo to its untiring song. These notes, greatly resembling
those of its eastern relative, may be heard from early dawn almost
even to the close of the following night. These are described as loud, varied,
high-toned, and melodious, rising and falling with the sweetest cadence, fascinating
the listener most powerfully with sensations of a pleasing sadness,
its closing note seeming like a shrill cry of appealing distress, and then sinking
faintly on the ear. It is described as very shy and retiring in its habits,
and can be but very rarely observed closely while thus engaged in song.
On these occasions the bird is said to sit up conspicuously on a lofty bough,
near the summit of the tree, his throat swelling with the excitement, and
seeming to take a great delight in the sound of his own music.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumichrast found this bird on the Plateau of Mexico, and also in the
alpine regions of Vera Cruz. It was found to the height of 8,300 feet, and
never lower than 4,000.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are of an oblong-oval shape, one end but slightly
more rounded than the other, and measure 1.10 of an inch in length by .65
in breadth. They have a bluish-green ground, blotched and splashed with
markings of a rusty-brown, for the most part more numerous about the
larger end.</p>

The species described as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanospiza parellina</i> in the Birds of North
America, but which so far has not been actually detected north of Mexico,
is a miniature <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Guiraca</i>, more related, however, to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">G. concreta</i> than to
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cærulea</i>. It is easily distinguished from the latter by more lobed bill,
darker back and under parts, absence of rufous wing-bands, and inferior
size. Length, 5 inches; wing, 2.50.</p>

<p>Males from the Pacific coast region (California, Colima, etc.) have tails
considerably longer than eastern specimens, while those from California are
of a much lighter and less purplish blue, the difference being much the same
as between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sialia sialis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. azurea</i>.</p>

<p>Autumnal and winter males have the feathers generally, especially on the
back and breast, tipped with light brown, obscuring somewhat the blue,
though producing a beautiful appearance.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Blue Grosbeak, though more a bird of the Southern States,
is also one both of an extended and of an irregular distribution. It was
even met with one year in the vicinity of Calais, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr>, although none have
been known to occur in any part of the country between that point and New
York City. It is found from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>The extent to which it is distributed throughout California is inferred,
rather than known. Dr. Cooper noticed one at Fort Mohave, May 6, and
afterwards saw many more frequenting the trees and bushes along the river,
and singing a lively song, which he compares with that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carpodacus
frontalis</i>. He also saw them at Los Angeles and at Santa Barbara, and
states that they were found at Pit River, in the extreme northeastern part
of the State, by Dr. Newberry. They were observed to frequent the banks
of streams crossing the great interior plains and deserts, where there was
little vegetation except a few bushes.</p>

<p>The Blue Grosbeak was only met with by Mr. Ridgway and his party at
Sacramento. It does not occur&mdash;or, if so, it was not seen&mdash;in the interior so
far to the north as the route of Mr. King’s survey. At Sacramento it was
found frequenting the same localities as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanospiza amæna</i>, and appeared
to be characteristic of the cottonwood copses. Their nests were found between
the 18th and the 29th of June, and were all in similar situations.
These were built in small cottonwood-trees, on the edge of the copse, and
were all about six feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Mr. John Burroughs, in one of his charming popular essays<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span>
on the general
habits of our birds, refers to their occasional preference, in sites for their
nests, of the borders of frequented roadsides, and mentions finding a nest of
the Blue Grosbeak among the trees that line one of the main streets and
fashionable drives leading out of Washington City, less than half a mile
from the boundary. There, he states, this bird, which, according to Audubon’s
observations, is shy and recluse, affecting remote marshes and the borders
of large ponds of stagnant water, had placed its nest in the lowest twig
<!--095.png--><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 79]</span>
of the lowest branch of a large sycamore immediately over a great thoroughfare,
and so near the ground that a person standing in a cart or sitting on a
horse could have reached it with his hand. The nest was composed mainly
of fragments of newspaper and stalks of grass, and though so low, was remarkably
well concealed by one of the peculiar clusters of twigs and leaves
which characterize this tree. The nest contained young when he discovered
it, and though the parent birds were much annoyed by his loitering about
beneath the tree, they paid but little attention to the stream of vehicles that
was constantly passing. It was a source of wonder to him when the birds
could have built it, as they are so much shyer when building than at other
times. They must have worked mostly in the early morning, when they
could have the place all to themselves. The same observer also noticed
another pair of Blue Grosbeaks that had built their nest in a graveyard
within the city limits. This was placed in a low bush, and the male continued
to sing at intervals till the young were ready to fly. The song of this
bird he describes as a rapid, intricate warble, like that of the Indigo Bird,
though stronger and louder. Indeed, these two birds so much resemble
each other in color, form, voice, manner, and general habits, that, were it not
for the difference in size,&mdash;the Grosbeak being nearly as large again as the
Indigo Bird,&mdash;he thinks it would be a hard matter to tell them apart. The
females of both birds are clad in the same reddish-brown suits, as are also
the young during the first season.</p>

<p>The nest of this species has also been found built in a tree within the
grounds of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington.</p>

<p>The only time I ever met with this species was at Carlisle, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>, in June,
1843. The previous month Professor Baird had found its nest in a low tree,
in open ground, and we found these birds still frequenting the same grounds,
where we found another nest containing three eggs. It was in a low thorn-tree
on the edge of a wood, but standing out in open ground. The nest was
about five feet from the ground.</p>

<p>The Smithsonian specimens are from Carlisle, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>, obtained in April,
May, and August; from Georgia, Texas, New Mexico, Nebraska, Mexico, etc.
Mr. Lawrence enumerates this among the birds found near New York City.
Mr. Dresser found it common near Matamoras in July and August. It was
breeding there, though, owing to the lateness of the season, he was unable to
procure any of its eggs. Dr. Coues speaks of it as generally distributed in
Arizona, but nowhere very common. A single specimen was taken near
Fort Whipple, August 10. Turnbull regarded it as a rare straggler to the
southern counties of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, arriving there in the
middle of May. Dr. Woodhouse found it common in the Indian Territory
and Texas. Lieutenant Couch mentions seeing this bird first near Monterey,
the male always preceding the female. He speaks of them as exceedingly
tame. Mr. J. H. Clark states that this bird was not often seen, and, when
observed, was generally solitary, preferring the dark ravines and the cañons
<!--096.png--><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 80]</span>
on the mountain-sides. It is not mentioned by Sumichrast as a bird of Vera
Cruz, but was found during the winter months at Oaxaca, Mexico, by Mr.
Boucard.</p>

<p>Mr. O. Salvin states (Ibis, <abbr title="Three, page">III, p.</abbr> 352) that he found this species, though
not of very common occurrence, pretty generally distributed, in winter,
throughout Vera Paz. He met with it on the Plains of Salamà, and all the
collections from the warmer districts to the northward of Coban contained
specimens. It was found by Mr. George H. White near Mexico.</p>

<p>Wilson speaks of this bird as retired and solitary, and also as a scarce
species, and as having but few notes, its most common one being a loud
<i class="birdcall">chuck</i>. He was, however, aware that at times they have a few low sweet-toned
notes. He mentions their being kept in Charleston in cages, but as
seldom singing in confinement. He fed a caged bird of this species on Indian
corn, which it easily broke with its powerful bill; also on hemp-seed, millet,
and berries. He speaks of them as timid, watchful, silent, and active.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon was, apparently, somewhat at fault in regard to the peculiarities
of this species. His accounts of the eggs of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyranga æstiva</i>
are entirely inapplicable to that species, and, so far as I know, apply to no
other bird than the Blue Grosbeak, to which they exactly correspond. He
makes no mention and gives no description of the eggs of the latter. His
statements as to the nest appear to be correct.</p>

<p>Dr. Bachman kept several of these birds in an aviary; two of these mated,
took possession of the nest of a Cardinal Grosbeak, which they drove off,
and laid two eggs that were unfortunately destroyed. In the aviary these
birds were silent. Mr. Audubon kept one, in confinement, with him in Edinburgh.
It had been raised from the nest. This bird frequently sang in the
night, and before dawn. It was extremely tame, coming out or going into
its cage at pleasure, perching on the head-dress of Mrs. Audubon, or on the
heads of other members of the family, alighting on the table and feeding on
almost anything given to it. If a gold or silver coin was thrown upon the
table he would go to it, take it up in his bill, and apparently toss it about
with pleasure. After bathing he would go to the fire and perch on the fender
to dry himself. He would attack other birds, if put into the cage with him.
In feeding he sometimes held his food in his claws like a Hawk.</p>

<p>The eggs of this bird are of a uniform light-blue color, and most resemble
those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sialia arctica</i>, but are larger and of a lighter color. Their color
is quite fugitive, and readily fades into a dull white upon even a slight exposure
to light. They are of an oval shape, equally rounded at either end,
and measure .98 of an inch in length by .65 in breadth.</p>

barely longer than the inner, its claw falling
short of the base of the middle; hind toe
about equal to the middle without claw.

<p>In this species, which may be considered the type of the genus, the tail is
slightly emarginate; the second quill is longest, the first shorter than the
fourth.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Indigo Bird of the Eastern States is found in
nearly uniform and tolerable abundance in various parts of the United
States, from the valley of the Missouri to the Atlantic, and from Florida to
New Brunswick. It is a summer visitant, but rare, in Eastern Maine, but is
common in the western part of the State, where it arrives early in May, and
where it breeds. Mr. Allen speaks of it as not very common in the vicinity
of Springfield, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, arriving there about the middle of May, and breeding
in gardens, orchards, and the edges of woods, and making its nests in bushes.
It leaves there about the middle of September.</p>

<p>In the eastern part of the State it is very unequally distributed. In certain
localities it has not been met with, but in other favorite places it seems
to be quite common, and to be on the increase. In the gardens of Brookline
and Roxbury they are comparatively quite abundant. Mr. Maynard gives
May 10 as the earliest date of their coming. He also states that in the
autumn they are found in flocks, and frequent roadsides, high sandy fields,
<!--099.png--><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 83]</span>
and rocky pastures, which I have never noticed. According to Dr. Coues, it
is common and breeds as far south as Columbia, <abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr>, and, according to Mr.
McIlwraith, it is a common summer resident in the neighborhood of Hamilton,
Canada West. Specimens have been procured as far west as Fort Riley
in Kansas. It passes the winter in Guatemala, where it is quite abundant,
though a very large proportion of specimens received from there, in collections,
are immature birds. It was not found in Vera Cruz by Mr. Sumichrast,
nor is it given by Mr. Allen as found by him in Western Iowa, while
it was common both in Northern Illinois and in Indiana. It was, however,
found by Mr. Allen, in Kansas, in considerable numbers, near Leavenworth,
in the spring of 1871. It was not met with by Mr. Dresser in Southwestern
Texas, though Dr. Woodhouse found it quite common in the prairies of
that State, where its pleasant song was heard in the timber on their edges,
or in the thickets on the borders of the streams in the Indian Territory,
where it was quite abundant. It was not observed on the Mexican Boundary
Survey.</p>

<p>These birds were found, by Mr. Boucard, abundant throughout the State
of Oaxaca, Mexico, having been taken both among the mountains near Totontepec,
and among the hot lowlands near Plaza Vicente.</p>

<p>According to Wilson, this bird is not noticed in Pennsylvania much, if
any, earlier than its first appearance in New England, and it leaves at about
the same time. He observed it in great abundance both in South Carolina
and Georgia.</p>

<p>In manners it is active and sprightly, and its song is vigorous and pleasant.
It is considered a better singer than either the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ciris</i> or the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amœna</i>. It
usually stations itself, in singing, on some high position, the top of a tree or
of a chimney, where it chants its peculiar and charming song for quite a
space of time. Its song consists of a repetition of short notes, at first loud
and rapid, but gradually less frequent, and becoming less and less distinct.
It sings with equal animation both in May and July, and its song may be
occasionally heard even into August, and not less during the noonday heat
of summer than in the cool of the morning. Nuttall describes its animated
song as a lively strain, composed of a repetition of short notes. The most
common of its vocal expressions sounds like <i class="birdcall">tshe-tshe-tshe</i>, repeated several
times. While the female is engaged in the cares of incubation, or just as
the brood has appeared, the song of the male is said to be much shortened.
In the village of Cambridge, Nuttall observed one of this species regularly
chanting its song from the point of a forked lightning-rod, on a very tall
house.</p>

<p>The Indigo Bird usually builds its nest in the centre of a low thick bush.
The first nest I ever met with was built in a thick sumach that had grown up
at the bottom of a deep excavation, some fifteen feet below the surface, and
but two feet above the base of the shrub. This same nest was occupied five
successive summers. It was almost wholly built of matting that the birds
<!--100.png--><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 84]</span>
had evidently taken from the ties of our grapevines. Each year the nest
was repaired with the same material. Once only they had two broods in one
season. The second brood was not hatched out until September, and the
family was not ready to migrate until after nearly all its kindred had assembled
and gone. This nest, though principally made of bare matting, was
very neatly and thoroughly lined with hair. Other nests are made of coarse
grasses and sedges, and all are usually lined in a similar manner.</p>

<p>Audubon and Wilson describe the eggs of this bird as blue, with purplish
spots at the larger end. All that I have ever seen are white, with a slight
tinge of greenish or blue, and unspotted. I have never been able to meet
with a spotted egg of this bird, the identification of which was beyond
suspicion. They are of a rounded-oval shape, one side is only a little more
pointed than the other. They measure .75 of an inch in length by .58 in
breadth. They resemble the eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. amœna</i>, but are smaller, and are not
so deeply tinged with blue.</p>

<p>This species is about the size of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C.

females of the two species are scarcely
distinguishable, except by the faint traces of one or two white bands on the
wings in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amœna</i>. Sometimes both the throat and the upper part of the
breast are tinged with pale brownish-buff.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Lazuli Finch was first obtained by Mr. Say, who met with
<!--101.png--><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 85]</span>
it in Long’s expedition. It was observed, though rarely, along the banks of
the Arkansas River during the summer months, as far as the base of the
Rocky Mountains. It was said to frequent the bushy valleys, keeping much
in the grass, after its food, and seldom alighting on either trees or shrubs.</p>

<p>Townsend, who found this rather a common bird on the Columbia, regarded
it as shy and retiring in its habits, the female being very rarely seen.
It possesses lively and pleasing powers of song, which it pours forth from
the upper branches of low trees. Its nests were usually found placed in
willows along the margins of streams, and were composed of small sticks,
fine grasses, and buffalo-hair.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall found the nest of this bird fastened between the stem and two
branches of a large fern. It was funnel-shaped, being six inches in height
and three in breadth.</p>

<p>This bird possibly occurs quite rarely, as far east as the Mississippi, as I
have what is said to be its egg taken from a nest near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis. It only
becomes abundant on the plains. Mr. Ridgway found it very generally distributed
throughout his route, inhabiting all the bushy localities in the
fertile districts. He regarded it as, in nearly every respect, the exact
counterpart of the eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. cyanea</i>. The notes of the two birds are so
exactly the same that their song would be undistinguishable but for the fact
that in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amœna</i> it is appreciably weaker. He found their nests usually
in the low limbs of trees, near their extremity, and only a few feet from the
ground. Mr. J. A. Allen found this species common in Colorado, more so
among the foot-hills than on the plains, but does not appear to have met
with it in Kansas.</p>

<p>This species, Mr. Lord states, visits Vancouver Island and British Columbia
early in the summer, arriving at the island in May, and rather later east of
the Cascades. The song of the male is said to be feeble, and only now and
then indulged in, as if to cheer his more sombre partner during incubation.
The nest, he adds, is round and open at the top, composed of various materials
worked together, lined with hair, and placed in a low bush, usually by
the side of a stream.</p>

<p>The Lazuli Finch was met with in large numbers, and many of their nests
procured, by Mr. Xantus, in the neighborhood of Ft. Tejon, California. Indeed,
it is a very abundant species generally on the Pacific coast, and is found at
least as far north as Puget Sound, during the summer. It arrives at San
Diego, according to Dr. Cooper, about April 22, and remains there until October.
A male bird, kept in a cage over winter, was found to retain its blue
plumage. It is a favorite cage-bird in California, where it is absurdly known
as the Indigo Bird. During the summer months, according to Dr. Cooper,
there is hardly a grove in the more open portions of the State uninhabited by
one or more pairs of this beautiful species. Although the female is very shy
and difficult to obtain, except on the nest, the male is not timid, and frequently
sings his lively notes from the top of some bush or tree, continuing
<!--102.png--><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 86]</span>
musical in all weathers and throughout the summer. He describes its song
as unvaried, as rather monotonous, and closely resembling that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. cyanea</i>.</p>

<p>Their nest, he adds, is usually built in a bush, not more than three or four
feet from the ground, formed of fibrous roots, strips of bark, and grass, with a
lining of vegetable down or hair, and securely bound to the surrounding
branches. The eggs, five in number, he describes as white, faintly tinged
with blue. At Santa Barbara he found them freshly laid May 6.</p>

<p>These birds are never gregarious, though the males come in considerable
flocks in the spring, several days before the females. They travel at night,
arriving at Santa Cruz about April 12. A nest found by Dr. Cooper, May 7,
in a low bush close to a public road, was about three feet from the ground.
It was very strongly built, supported by a triple fork of the branch, and was
composed of blades of grass firmly interwoven, and lined with horsehair and
cobwebs. It measured three inches in height and three and three fourths
in width. The cavity was two inches deep and one and three fourths wide.</p>

<p>In Arizona Dr. Coues found this bird a summer resident, but not abundant.</p>

<p>At Puget Sound this bird arrives about May 15. Dr. Suckley states that
in Oregon it was observed returning from the south, in large flocks, in one
instance of several hundred individuals.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Lazuli, when fresh, are of a light blue, which on the least
exposure soon fades into a bluish-white. They are almost exactly oval in
shape, and measure .75 by .60 of an inch. One end is somewhat more
rounded, but the difference is slight.</p>

<p>Autumnal and winter males have the bright tints very slightly obscured

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This beautiful species has only doubtful claims to a place in
our fauna. It is a Mexican species, and may occasionally cross into our
territory. It was met with at Boquillo, in the Mexican State of New Leon,
by Lieutenant Couch. It was procured in Guatemala by Dr. Van Patten
and by Salvin, and is given by Bonaparte as from Peru. It is also found at
Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, where it is not rare, and where it breeds.</p>

<p>This bird is also found at Orizaba, according to Sumichrast, but is quite
rare in the State of Vera Cruz. Its common name is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prusiano</i>. Its geographical

<p>Among the memoranda of Mr. Xantus made at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, we find
the following in connection with this species: 517, nest and three eggs of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanospiza versicolor</i>; obtained May 5 on a myrtle hanging down from very
high perpendicular bluffs, off the Trajoles, at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas. 1535, nest
and eggs of the same found on a vine ten feet high.</p>

<p>Specimens of this species were taken by Mr. Boucard at Oaxaca, Mexico,
during the winter months.</p>

<p>Specimens of this species from all parts of its range appear to be quite
identical.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Nonpareil or Painted Bunting of the Southern and Southeastern
States has a somewhat restricted distribution, not being found any
farther to the north on the Atlantic Coast than South Carolina and Georgia,
and probably only in the more southern portions of those States. It has
been traced as far to the west as Texas. It was also met with at Monterey,
Mexico, by Lieutenant Couch, and in winter by Mr. Boucard, at Plaza Vicente,
Oaxaca.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser found it very common both at Matamoras and at San Antonio,
breeding in both places. Dr. Coues did not meet with it in Columbia,
<abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr>, and considers it as confined to the low country, and as rare even there.
It breeds about the city of Charleston, <abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr>, from which neighborhood I
have received its eggs in considerable numbers, from Dr. Bachman. It is
also found in the lower counties of Georgia, and breeds in the vicinity of
Savannah. It was not met with by Dr. Gerhardt in the northern portion
of that State. Dr. Woodhouse found it quite abundant in all parts of
Texas, where he tells us the sweet warblings of this beautiful and active
little Finch added much to the pleasures of his trip across the prairies. Its
favorite places of resort appeared to be small thickets, and when singing it
selected the highest branches of a bush.</p>

<p>In the Report on the birds of the Mexican Boundary Survey, Lieutenant
Couch met with this species among the low hedges in the suburbs of
Pesqueria Grande. Mr. J. H. Clark observed that the individuals of this
species diminished as they proceeded westward. The male was almost always
seen alone, flying a long distance for so small a bird. Their nests, he
adds, were built of very fine grass, in low bushes, and resting in the crotch
of the twigs. Males were never seen about the nest, but the females were
so gentle as to allow themselves to be taken off the nest, which was deliberately
done on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly reports having often listened to the melodious warblings of
<!--105.png--><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 89]</span>
this beautiful Finch in the vicinity of San Antonio, Texas, where he found
it very abundant among the thick mesquite-bushes, in the month of July.
It was deservedly a great favorite there, both on account of the beauty of its
plumage and its notes.</p>

<p>Wilson found this bird one of the most numerous summer birds of Lower
Louisiana, where it was universally known among the French inhabitants as
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Pape</i>. Its gay dress and its docility of manners procured it many admirers.
Wilson also states that he met with these birds in the low countries
of all the Southern States, in the vicinity of the sea and along the
borders of the large rivers, particularly among the rice plantations. He
states that a few were seen near the coast in North Carolina, but they were
more numerous in South Carolina, and still more so in Georgia, especially
the lower parts. At Natchez, on the Mississippi, they were comparatively
scarce, but below Baton Rouge, on the levee, they appeared in great numbers.
Around New Orleans they were warbling from almost every fence.
Their notes very much resemble those of the Indigo Bird, but lack their
energy, and are more feeble and concise.</p>

<p>Wilson met with these birds very generally in the houses of the French
inhabitants of New Orleans. In the aviary of a wealthy French planter
near Bayou Fourche, he found two pairs of these birds so far reconciled
to their confinement as to have nests and hatch out their eggs. Wilson
was of the opinion that with the pains given to the Canary these birds
would breed with equal facility. Six of them, caught only a few days before
his departure, were taken with him by sea. They soon became reconciled
to their cage, and sang with great sprightliness. They were very fond of
flies, and watched with great eagerness as the passengers caught them for
their benefit, assembling in the front of the cage and stretching their heads
through the wires to receive them.</p>

<p>These birds, he states, arrive in Louisiana from the South about the middle
of April, and build early in May. They reach Savannah about the 20th
of April. Their nests are usually fixed in orange hedges or in the lower
branches of the trees. He often found them in common bramble and blackberry
bushes. They are formed exteriorly of dry grass intermingled with the
silk of caterpillars, with hair and fine rootlets. Some nests had eggs as late
as the 25th of June, which were probably a second brood. The food of this
bird consists of rice, insects, and various kinds of seeds. They also feed on
the seeds of ripe figs.</p>

<p>A single specimen of this species was detected by Mr. Ridgway in Southern
Illinois between Olney and Mount Carmel, on the 10th of June. It is
therefore presumed to be a rare summer resident in that locality.</p>

<p>The Nonpareil is possessed of a very pugnacious disposition, and, according
to Mr. Audubon, the bird-dealers of New Orleans take advantage of this
peculiarity in a very ingenious manner to trap them. A male bird is stuffed
and set up in an attitude of defence on the platform of a trap-cage. The
<!--106.png--><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 90]</span>
first male bird of this species that notices it is sure to make an attack upon
it, and is at once trapped. So pertinacious are they that even when thus
imprisoned the captive repeats its attack upon its supposed rival. They
feed almost immediately upon being caught, and usually thrive in confinement,
Audubon mentioning one that had been caged for ten years.</p>

<p>This bird is very easily made to breed in confinement. Dr. Bachman has
had a single pair thus raise three broods in a season.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species measure .80 by .65 of an inch, and do not at all
resemble the eggs of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cyanea</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">amœna</i>. They have a dull or pearly-white
ground, and are very characteristically marked with blotches and dots
of purplish and reddish brown.</p>

<p>The specimen upon which the preceding description of the male has
been based is the only one in full plumage
we have seen, and was kindly lent
by Mr. P. L. Sclater. It was collected in
Honduras. Some of the feathers of the
back have grayish tips. The specimen
described by Mr. Lawrence as <a name="note3" id="note3"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. albigularis</i>,
though male, is, in most respects,
like the female, except that the wings
and tail are darker, the color of the upper
part grayer, and the interscapular feathers
blotched with black. The black of the
head is strongly indicated, the feathers,
however, all with gray margins. In this
and another, a little further advanced, from San Diego, Mexico, (4096,) there
is a very faint indication of the black pectoral band, and there is no trace
of the whitish of the rump.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This pretty little tropical form of Sparrow can only rest a claim
to be included in our fauna by its occasional presence on the Rio Grande in
Texas. It is found throughout Mexico and Central America.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumichrast found it throughout the State of Vera Cruz, except only
in the elevated or alpine regions. Its common name was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Frailecito</i>. It was
abundant throughout the hot and the temperate regions as well as the plateau.</p>

<p>This species was first met with near the Lake of Peten, in Guatemala, by
<!--108.png--><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 92]</span>
M. Morelet, and was described from his specimens in the Paris Museum
by Prince Bonaparte. Mr. Salvin found it a not uncommon species about
Dueñas, where it is generally to be found amongst the tall weeds on the
edge of the lake. It was also found at Belize. From a letter of Mr. Salvin,
published in the Ibis of 1859 (p. 468), we quote the following in reference
to the nest of this species, which is all the information we have in relation
to this diminutive Sparrow: “A day or two ago I found two nests of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spermophila moreleti</i>, and took one rotten dried-up egg from one with a
young one in it. Nothing could be more different than this nest and that
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. bicolor</i>, so well described by Mr. Newton. That of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. moreleti</i>, instead
of the loose domed structure of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. bicolor</i>, with a large side-entrance, composed
entirely of one material, is one of the neatest nests you ever saw,&mdash;a
beautiful, open, transparent nest, composed of fine roots and fibres, and lined
with horsehair. It is not placed resting on a branch, but is suspended like
a Reed Warbler’s (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salicaria arundinacea</i>), by several small twigs. The eggs,
too, differ materially.” Mr. Salvin gives no description of these eggs.</p>

<p>This bird was found a resident during the winter months, and in May also,
at Plaza Vicente, in the State of Oaxaca, Mexico. This is in the low or
hot lands of that region.</p>

Quite a large series of this species from the various West Indian Islands
show a considerable variation in the amount of black in male birds; nothing
characteristic of the different islands, however, for, in specimens from each,
individuals are to be found agreeing in every respect with the stages described
above.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Black-faced Finch of Jamaica and other West India Islands
claims a place in the fauna of the United States as an occasional visitant of
Florida; of how common occurrence on that peninsula we cannot determine.
It was taken there in the spring of 1871 by Mr. Maynard, and is
possibly an accidental rather than a regular visitant. It is found in many
of the West India Islands, though being resident in their several places of
abode, they naturally exhibit certain characteristics as of distinct races.
The eggs of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix bird differ considerably from those of the Jamaica
one.</p>

<p>The Messrs. Newton, in their account of the birds of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix, mention
this bird as having a Bunting-like song, heard always very early in the
morning. It is said to frequent the curing-houses, hopping on the uncovered
sugar-hogsheads, and making a plentiful meal therefrom. It is very sociable,
and feeds in small flocks, mostly on the ground among the guinea-grass.
The crops of those dissected were usually found to contain small seeds.
They build domed nests in low bushes, thickets of bamboo, or among creepers
against the side of a house, seldom more than four feet from the ground,
composed entirely of dry grass, the interior being lined with finer materials
of the same. The opening is on one side, and is large for the size of the
nest. They breed from the middle of May to the end of July. The eggs
are white, spotted with red, especially at the larger end. The usual number
of eggs is three, very rarely four. Their measurement is .65 by .50
of an inch.</p>

<p>In Jamaica Mr. March speaks of it as the most common of the Grass
Finches, of which there are three other species, and as nesting at all seasons of
the year in low trees and bushes. Near homesteads, in building their domed
nests, they make use of shreds, scraps of cloth, bits of cotton, and other trash.
Their eggs, he says, are three and sometimes even six in number; and he
mentions their varying both as to dimensions and coloring, which may
explain the difference between the eggs from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix and Jamaica. Those
from the latter place measure .72 by .50 of an inch, and the markings are
more of a brown than a red color.</p>

<p>Mr. Hill adds that the Grass Finch very frequently selects a shrub on
which the wasps have built, fixing the entrance close to their cells.</p>

<p>Mr. Gosse states that the only note of this species is a single harsh guttural
squeak, difficult either to imitate or to describe.</p>

<p>The wing is considerably rounded, the fourth and fifth quills longest;
the first as long as the secondaries, the
second longer than the seventh. The
tail is long, graduated on the sides, the
outer about half an inch shorter than
the middle. The feathers are very
broad to the end and obliquely truncate.
They are rather broader than in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cardinalis virginianus</i>. The crest is
narrower and longer, and confined to
the middle of the crown; it extends
back about 1.80 inches from the base
of the bill.</p>

<p>The carmine of the breast is somewhat
hidden by grayish tips to the
feathers; that of the throat is streaked a little with darker. The exposed
surfaces of the wing-coverts and of secondaries and tertials are like the back.
The tail-feathers are tipped with brownish.</p>

<p>Specimens from Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas are very much smaller than any others,
measuring only, wing, 3.30; tail, 3.80. The crest is dull carmine, instead
of dark wine-purple; the red tinge on wing and tail much fainter, and the
sides, as well as the gray tints everywhere, more brownish; there is none of
that dark burnt-carmine tint to the red of lores and cheeks observable in all
the Texas specimens. <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 49,758, Camp Grant, Arizona, is like the Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Lucas birds in colors, except that the crest is dusky, but the proportions are

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Texan Cardinal was originally described as a bird of Mexico
by Prince Charles Lucien Bonaparte in the Proceedings of the Zoölogical
Society of London. It has since been ascertained to inhabit the southern
central portions of our country, its range of extension northerly bringing it
within the limits of the United States. In Texas, on the Rio Grande, it is
resident throughout the year, or of but limited migration in the coldest
weather. It was not observed by Dr. Coues in Arizona, but is said to occur
in the southern portion of that Territory. It was found breeding at Cape
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas by Mr. Xantus. It is not named by Sumichrast among the birds
of Vera Cruz.</p>

<p>Its habits are said to be of the same general character with those of our
common Cardinal.</p>

<p>The specimens from which this bird was first described were procured in
the vicinity of the city of Mexico. The first obtained within the limits of
<!--113.png--><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 97]</span>
the United States were observed by Captain McCown of the U. S. Army,
at Ringgold Barracks, in Texas. Since then it has been procured by several
of the naturalists accompanying the government expeditions. It was obtained
in New Leon, Mexico, by Lieutenant Couch; in Texas, by Major
Emory; in Texas and at El Paso, by Lieutenant Parke.</p>

<p>When first seen, in March, in the State of Tamaulipas, by Lieutenant
Couch, it was in flocks, very shy and difficult of approach. It did not occur
much in open fields, but seemed to prefer the vicinity of fences and bushes.
It was often seen in company with the common Cardinal.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly found this bird quite abundant in the vicinity of El Paso,
but did not observe it elsewhere. It kept generally in flocks of from three
to six, frequenting the hedges and fruit-trees in the vicinity of houses. It
became very restless when approached, flying from branch to branch and
from tree to tree, uttering its peculiar note with great vehemence.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann met with the first specimen of this bird in a dry cañon, a
little to the east of the crossing of San Pedro River. It was perched on a
bush, seemed wearied and lost, and was probably a wanderer. No more were
seen until he reached El Paso. There he found it everywhere among the
hedges and trees, and continued to meet with it occasionally on his road,
until his party left civilization behind. It erects its crest as it moves actively
about in search of food, and utters at intervals a clear, plaintive whistle,
varied by a few detached notes.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser considers this species rather a straggler from Mexico than as a
Texan bird. Near Eagle Pass and Piedras Negras he found it abundant, but
it became scarce as soon as he travelled a few miles into Texas. He saw none
north or east of the Leona. He was told that quantities breed near Eagle
Pass, and he saw not a few in cages that had been reared from the nest.
He found it a shy bird, and difficult to shoot. When followed, it flies about
uneasily, perching on the top of some high bush, and erecting its long crest,
uttering a clear, plaintive whistle. Sometimes it would take to the thick
brushwood and creep through the bushes so that it was impossible to get a
shot at it. On the Lower Rio Grande it was of uncommon occurrence. He
noticed a single pair near Matamoras in August, 1864.</p>

<p>Captain McCown, in his account of this species, published by Cassin,
writes that, so far as seen on the Rio Grande, this handsome species appeared
to have a strong partiality for damp and bushy woods. So far as he observed,
it never ventured far from the river. He was under the impression that this
bird remains in Texas all the year, having met with it so late in the fall and
again so early in the spring, that, if not constantly resident, its migrations
must be very limited. He describes it as a gay, sprightly bird, generally
seen in company with others of the same species, frequently erecting its
crest and calling to its mate or comrades. It is rather shy, and not easily
approached. In its voice and general habits it appeared to him very similar
to the common species.</p>

<p><!--114.png--><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 98]</span>
The eggs of this species are of an oval shape, one end being only a little
less rounded than the other. Their average measurement is one inch in
length by .80 in breadth. Their ground-color is a dull chalky-white, over
which are distributed well-defined blotches of a light umber-brown, and also
a number of indistinct markings of purple. The spots are pretty uniform
in these colors, but vary greatly in size and distribution. In some eggs they
largely consist of fine dots, in others they are in bold blotches. In some the
brown is more confluent and the effect that of a deeper shade.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Specific Characters"><span class="sc">Sp. Char.</span></abbr>
A flattened crest of feathers on the crown. Bill red. Body generally
bright vermilion-red, darker on the back, rump, and tail. The feathers of the back
and rump bordered with brownish-gray. Narrow
band around the base of the bill, extending to eyes,
with chin and upper part of the throat black.</p>

<p class="small"><i class="sex">Female</i> of a duller red, and this only on the
wings, tail, and elongated feathers of the crown.
Above light olive; tinged with yellowish on the
head; beneath brownish-yellow, darkest on the
sides and across the breast. Black about the head
only faintly indicated. Length, 8.50; wing, 4.00;
tail, 4.50; culmen, .75; depth of bill, .58; breadth
of upper mandible, .35. (28,286 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, Mount Carmel,
Southern Illinois.)</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
More southern portions of United States
to the Missouri. Probably along valley of Rio
Grande to Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>The bill of this species is very large, and
shaped much as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hedymeles ludovicianus</i>.
The central feathers of the crest of the crown are longer than the lateral;
they spring from about the middle of the crown, and extend back about an
inch and a half from the base of the bill. The wings are much rounded,
the fourth longest, the second equal to the seventh, the first as long as the
secondaries. The tail is long, truncate at the end, but graduated on the
sides; the feathers are broad to the end, truncated obliquely at the end.</p>

Most North American specimens we have seen have the feathers of the back
edged with ashy; the more northern the less brightly colored, and larger.
Mexican skins (<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coccineus</i>) are deeper colored and without the olivaceous.
In all specimens from eastern North America the frontal black is very
distinct.</p>

<p>Specimens from the Eastern Province of United States, including Florida
and the Bermudas, are all alike in possessing those features distinguishing
the restricted <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">virginianus</i> from the races of Mexico, namely, the wide
black frontal band, and distinct gray edges to dorsal feathers, with small bill.
Specimens from Florida are scarcely smaller, and are not more deeply
colored than some examples from Southern Illinois. Rio Grande skins,
however, are slightly less in size, though identical in other respects.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Cardinal Grosbeak, the Redbird of the Southern States, is
one of our few birds that present the double attraction of a brilliant and
showy plumage with more than usual powers of song. In New England
and the more northern States it is chiefly known by its reputation as a
cage-bird, both its bright plumage and its sweet song giving it a high value.
It is a very rare and only an accidental visitor of Massachusetts, though a
pair was once known to spend the summer and to rear its brood in the
Botanical Gardens of Harvard College in Cambridge. It is by no means a
common bird even in Pennsylvania. In all the Southern States, from Virginia
to Mexico, it is a well-known favorite, frequenting gardens and plantations,
and even breeding within the limits of the larger towns and cities.
A single specimen of this bird was obtained near Dueñas, Guatemala, by
Mr. Salvin.</p>

<p>The song of this Grosbeak is diversified, pleasant, and mellow, delivered
with energy and ease, and renewed incessantly until its frequent repetitions
somewhat diminish its charms. Its peculiar whistle is not only loud and
clear, resembling the finest notes of the flageolet, but is so sweet and so
varied that by some writers it has been considered equal even to the notes
of the far-famed Nightingale of Europe. It is, however, very far from
being among our best singers; yet, as it is known to remain in full song
more than two thirds of the year, and while thus musical to be constant
and liberal in the utterance of its sweet notes, it is entitled to a conspicuous
place among our singing birds.</p>

<p>In its cage life the Cardinal soon becomes contented and tame, and will
live many years in confinement. Wilson mentions one instance in which a
Redbird was kept twenty-one years. They sing nearly throughout the year,
or from January to October. In the extreme Southern States they are more
or less resident, and some may be found all the year round. There is another
remarkable peculiarity in this species, and one very rarely to be met
with among birds, which is that the female Cardinal Grosbeak is an excellent
singer, and her notes are very nearly as sweet and as good as those
of her mate.</p>

<p><!--118.png--><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 102]</span>
This species has been traced as far to the west in its distribution as the
base of the Rocky Mountains, and into Mexico at the southwest. In Mexico
it is also replaced by a very closely allied variety, and at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas by
still another. It is given by Mr. Lawrence among the birds occurring near
New York City. He has occasionally met with it in New Jersey and at
Staten Island, and, in one instance, on New York Island, when his attention
was attracted to it by the loudness of its song.</p>

<p>It is given by Mr. Dresser as common throughout the whole of Texas
during the summer, and almost throughout the year, excepting only where
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. sinuata</i> is found. At Matamoras it was very common, and may be
seen caged in almost every Mexican hut. He found it breeding in great
abundance about San Antonio in April and May.</p>

<p>Mr. Cassin states that the Cardinal Bird is also known by the name of
Virginia Nightingale. He adds that it inhabits, for the greater part, low and
damp woods in which there is a profuse undergrowth of bushes, and is particularly
partial to the vicinity of watercourses. The male bird is rather
shy and careful of exposing himself.</p>

<p>Wilson mentions that in the lower parts of the Southern States, in the
neighborhood of settlements, he found them more numerous than elsewhere.
Their clear and lively notes, even in the months of January and February,
were, at that season, almost the only music. Along the roadsides and fences
he found them hovering in small groups, associated with Snowbirds and
various kinds of Sparrows. Even in Pennsylvania they frequent the borders
of creeks and rivulets during the whole year, in sheltered hollows,
covered with holly, laurel, and other evergreens. They are very fond of
Indian corn, a grain that is their favorite food. They are also said to feed
on various kinds of fruit.</p>

<p>The males of this species, during the breeding season, are described as very
pugnacious, and when confined together in the same cage they fight violently.
The male bird has even been known to destroy its mate. In Florida Mr.
Audubon found these birds mated by the 8th of February. The nest is
built in bushes, among briers, or in low trees, and in various situations, the
middle of a field, near a fence, or in the interior of a thicket, and usually
not far from running water. It has even been placed in the garden close to
the planter’s house. It is loosely built of dry leaves and twigs, with a large
proportion of dry grasses and strips of the bark of grapevines. Within, it is
finished and lined with finer stems of grasses wrought into a circular form.
There are usually two, and in the more Southern States three, broods in a
season.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon adds that they are easily raised from the nest, and have
been known to breed in confinement.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are of an oblong-oval shape, with but little difference
at either end. Their ground-color appears to be white, but is generally
so thickly marked with spots of ashy-brown and faint lavender tints as to
<!--119.png--><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 103]</span>
permit but little of its ground to be seen. The eggs vary greatly in size,
ranging from 1.10 inches to .98 of an inch in length, and from .80 to .78
in breadth.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> There appears to be nothing in the habits of this form of Cardinal,
as far as known, to distinguish it from the Virginia bird; the nest and
eggs, too, being almost identical. The latter average about one inch in length,
and .80 in breadth. Their ground-color is white, with a bluish tint. Their
markings are larger, and more of a rusty than an ashy brown, and the purple
spots are fewer and less marked than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. virginianus</i>.</p>

<p>The memoranda of Mr. John Xantus show that in one instance a nest of
this bird, containing two eggs, was found in a mimosa bush four feet from
the ground; another nest, with one egg, in a like situation; a third, containing
three eggs, was about three feet from the ground; a fourth, with
two eggs, was also found in a mimosa, but only a few inches above the
ground.</p>

the outer lateral toe a little the longer, and reaching a little beyond the base of the
middle claw. The hind claw about equal to its toe; the two together about equal to the
outer toe. Claws all stout, compressed, and moderately curved; in some western specimens
the claws much larger. Wings reaching
about to the end of the upper tail-coverts; short
and rounded, though the primaries are considerably
longer than the nearly equal secondaries

the first considerably shorter than the second,
and about as long as the secondaries. Tail considerably
longer than the wings, moderately

<p>In the large number of species or races included in this genus by authors,
there are certain differences of form, such as varying graduation of tail,

method of arrangement into groups.</p>

Few genera in birds exhibit such constancy in trifling variations of form
and color, and as these are closely connected with geographical distribution,
it seems reasonable to reduce many of the so-called species to a lower rank.
In the following synopsis, we arrange the whole of North American and
Mexican Pipilos into four sections, with their more positive species, and
in the subsequent discussion of the sections separately we shall give what

<p>After a careful study of the very large collection of Black-headed Pipilos
(leaving for the present the consideration of those with olive-green bodies)
in the Smithsonian Museum, we have come finally to the conclusion that all
the species described as having the scapulars and wing-coverts spotted with
white&mdash;as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arcticus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oregonus</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">megalonyx</i>, and even including the differently
colored <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. maculatus</i> of Mexico&mdash;are probably only geographical races
of one species, representing in the trans-Missouri region the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. erythrophthalmus</i>
of the eastern division of the continent. It is true that specimens may
be selected of the four races capable of accurate definition, but the transition
<!--123.png--><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 107]</span>
from one to the other is so gradual that a considerable percentage of the collection
can scarcely be assigned satisfactorily; and even if this were possible,
the differences after all are only such as are caused by a slight change in
the proportion of black, and the varying development of feet and wings.</p>

<p>Taking <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">maculatus</i> as it occurs in the central portion of its wide field of
distribution, with wing-spots of average size, we find these spots slightly
bordered, or at least often, with black, and the primaries edged externally
with white only towards the end. The exterior web of lateral tail-feather is
edged mostly with white; the terminal white patches of outer feather about
an inch long; that of inner web usually separated from the outer by a black
shaft-streak. In more northern specimens the legs are more dusky than
usual. The tail is variable, but longer generally than in the other races.
The claws are enormously large in many, but not in all specimens, varying
considerably; and the fourth primary is usually longest, the first equal to
or shorter than the secondaries. This is the race described as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. megalonyx</i>,
and characterizes the Middle Province, between the Sierra Nevada of California
and the eastern Rocky Mountains, or the great interior basin of the
continent; it occurs also near the head of the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>On the Pacific slope of California, as we proceed westward, we find a change
in the species, the divergence increasing still more as we proceed northward,
until in Oregon and Washington the extreme of range and alteration
is seen in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. oregonus</i>. Here the claws are much smaller, the white markings
restricted in extent so as to form quite small spots bordered externally by
black; the spots on the inner webs of tail much smaller, and even bordered
along the shaft with black, and the outer web of the lateral entirely black,
or with only a faint white edging. The concealed white of the head and
neck has disappeared also.</p>

<p>Proceeding eastward, on the other hand, from our starting-point, we find
another race, in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. arcticus</i>, occupying the western slope of the Missouri
Valley and the basin of the Saskatchewan, in which, on the contrary, the
white increases in quantity, and more and more to its eastern limit. The
black borders of the wing-patches disappear, leaving them white externally;
and decided white edgings are seen for the first time at the bases of primaries,
as well as near their ends, the two sometimes confluent. The terminal tail-patches
are larger, the outer web of the exterior feather is entirely white
except toward the very base, and we thus have the opposite extreme to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.
oregonus</i>. The wings are longer; the third primary longest; the first usually
longer than the secondaries or the ninth quill.</p>

<p>Finally, proceeding southward along the table-lands of Mexico, and
especially on their western slope, we find <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. maculatus</i> (the first described
of all) colored much like the females of the more northern races, except that
the head and neck are black, in decided contrast to the more olivaceous back.
The wing formula and pattern of markings are much like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">megalonyx</i>, the
claws more like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arcticus</i>. Even in specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">megalonyx</i>, from the southern
<!--124.png--><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 108]</span>
portion of its area of distribution, we find a tendency to an ashy or
brownish tinge on the rump, extending more or less along the back; few, if
any indeed, being uniformly black.</p>

<p>As, however, a general expression can be given to the variations referred
to, and as they have an important geographical relationship, besides a general
diagnosis, we give their characters and distribution in detail.</p>

<p>The general impression we derive from a study of the series is that the
amount of white on the wing and elsewhere decreases from the Missouri
River to the Pacific, exhibiting its minimum in Oregon and Washington, precisely
as in the small black Woodpeckers; that in the Great Basin the size
of the claws and the length of tail increases considerably; that the northern
forms are entirely black, and the more southern brown or olivaceous, except
on the head.</p>

<p>The following synopsis will be found to express the principal characteristics
of the species and their varieties, premising that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. arcticus</i> is more distinctly
definable than any of the others. We add the character of the green-bodied
Mexican species to complete the series.</p>

Upper parts generally, head and neck all round, and upper part of the
breast, glossy black, abruptly defined against
the pure white which extends to the anus,
but is bounded on the sides and under the
wings by light chestnut, which is sometimes
streaked externally with black. Feathers of
throat white in the middle. Under coverts
similar to sides, but paler. Edges of outer six primaries with white at the base and on
the middle of the outer web; inner two tertiaries also edged externally with white.
Tail-feathers black; outer web of the first, with the ends of the first to the third, white,
decreasing from the exterior one. Outermost quill usually shorter than ninth, or even
than secondaries; fourth quill longest, fifth scarcely shorter. Iris red; said to be sometimes
paler, or even white, in winter. Length, 8.75; wing, 3.75; tail, 4.10. Bill black,
legs flesh-color. <i class="sex">Female</i> with the black replaced by a rather rufous brown.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Eastern United States to the Missouri River; Florida (in winter).</p>

<p>The tail-feathers are only moderately graduated on the sides; the outer
about .40 of an inch shorter than the middle. The outer tail-feather has
the terminal half white, the outline transverse; the white of the second is
about half as long as that of the first; of the third half that of the second.
The chestnut of the sides reaches forward to the black of the neck, and is
visible when the wings are closed.</p>

A young bird has the prevailing color reddish-olive above, spotted with
lighter; beneath brownish-white, streaked thickly with brown.</p>

<p>The description above given may be taken as representing the average of
the species in the Northern and Middle States. Most specimens from the
Mississippi Valley differ in having the two white patches on the primaries
confluent; but this feature is not sufficiently constant to make it worthy of
more than passing notice, for occasionally western specimens have the white
spaces separated, as in the majority of eastern examples, while among the
latter there may, now and then, be found individuals scarcely distinguishable
from the average of western ones.</p>

<p>In Florida, however, there is a local, resident race, quite different from
these two northern styles, which are themselves not enough unlike to be
considered separately. This Florida race differs in much smaller size, very
restricted white on both wing and tail, and in having a yellowish-white instead
of blood-red iris. Further remarks on this Florida race will be found
under its proper heading (<a href="#Page_112">p. 708</a>), as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. erythrophthalmus</i>, <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alleni</i>.</p>

<p>Specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">erythrophthalmus</i>, as restricted, from Louisiana, as is the case
with most birds from the Lower Mississippi region, exhibit very intense
colors compared with those from more northern portions, or even Atlantic
coast specimens from the same latitude.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Ground Robin, Towhee, Chewink, Charee, or Joreet, as it is
variously called, has an extended distribution throughout the eastern United
States, from Florida and Georgia on the southeast to the Selkirk Settlements
on the northwest, and as far to the west as the edge of the Great Plains,
where it is replaced by other closely allied races. It breeds almost wherever
found, certainly in Georgia, and, I have no doubt, sparingly in Florida.</p>

<p>This bird was not observed in Texas by Mr. Dresser. It has been found
in Western Maine, where it is given by Mr. Verrill as a summer visitant,
and where it breeds, but is not common. It arrives there the first of May.
It is not given by Mr. Boardman as occurring in Eastern Maine. In Massachusetts
it is a very abundant summer visitant, arriving about the last of
April, and leaving about the middle of October. It nests there the last of
<!--129.png--><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 111]</span>
May, and begins to sit upon the eggs about the first of June. It is slightly
gregarious just as it is preparing to leave, but at all other times is to be met
with only in solitary pairs.</p>

<p>The Ground Robin is in many respects one of the most strongly characterized
of our North American birds, exhibiting peculiarities in which all the
members of this genus share to a very large degree. They frequent close and
sheltered thickets, where they spend a large proportion of their time on the
ground among the fallen leaves, scratching and searching for worms, larvæ,
and insects. Though generally resident in retired localities, it is far from
being a shy or timid bird. I have known it to show itself in a front yard,
immediately under the windows of a dwelling and near the main street of
the village, where for hours I witnessed its diligent labors in search of food.
The spot was very shady, and unfrequented during the greater part of the
day. It was not disturbed when the members of the family passed in or out.</p>

<p>The call-note of this bird is very peculiar, and is variously interpreted in
different localities. It has always appeared to me that the Georgian <i class="birdcall">jo-rēēt</i>
was at least as near to its real notes as <i class="birdcall">tow-hēē</i>. Its song consists of a few
simple notes, which very few realize are those of this bird. In singing, the
male is usually to be seen on the top of some low tree. These notes are
uttered in a loud voice, and are not unmusical. Wilson says its song resembles
that of the Yellow-Hammer of Europe, but is more varied and mellow.
Nuttall speaks of its notes as simple, guttural, and monotonous, and of its
voice as clear and sonorous. The song, which he speaks of as quaint and
somewhat pensive, he describes as sounding like <i class="birdcall">t’sh’d-wĭtee-tĕ-tĕ-tĕ-tĕ-tĕ</i>.</p>

<p>Wilson says this bird is known in Pennsylvania as the “Swamp Robin.”
If so, this is a misnomer. In New England it has no predilection for low
or moist ground; and I have never found it in such situations. Its favorite
haunts are dry uplands, near the edges of woods, or high tracts covered with
a low brushwood, selecting for nesting-places the outer skirts of a wood,
especially one of a southern aspect. The nest is sunk in a depression in
the ground, the upper edges being usually just level with the ground. It is
largely composed of dry leaves and coarse stems as a base, within which is
built a firmer nest of dry bents well arranged, usually with no other lining.
It is generally partially concealed by leaves or a tuft of grass, and is not
easily discovered unless the female is seen about it.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues says these Buntings are chiefly spring and autumnal visitants
near Washington, only a few breeding. They are very abundant from April
25 to May 10, and from the first to the third week of October, and are
partially gregarious. Their migrations are made by day, and are usually in
small companies in the fall, but singly in the spring. Wilson found them in
the middle districts of Virginia, and from thence south to Florida, during
the months of January, February, and March. Their usual food is obtained
among the dry leaves, though they also feed on hard seeds and gravel. They
are not known to commit any depredations upon harvests. They may be
<!--130.png--><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 112]</span>
easily accustomed to confinement, and in a few days will become quite tame.
When slightly wounded and captured, they at first make a sturdy resistance,
and bite quite severely. They are much attached to their young, and when
approached evince great anxiety, the female thrusting herself forward to
divert attention by her outcries and her simulated lameness.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are of a rounded-oval shape, and have a dull-white
ground, spotted with dots and blotches of a wine-colored brown.
These usually are larger than in the other species, and are mostly congregated
about the larger end, and measure .98 of an inch in length by .80 in
breadth.</p>

<p>This interesting variety of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilo erythrophthalmus</i> was found in Florida,
in the spring of 1869, by Mr. C. J. Maynard, and probably represents the
species as resident in that State. It is considerably smaller than the average
(length, 7.75; extent, 10.00; wing, 3.00; tarsus, .95), and has very appreciably
less white on the tail. The outer web of outer feather is only narrowly
edged with white, instead
of being entirely
so to the shaft
(except in one specimen),
and the terminal
white tip, confined
to the inner
web, is only from .50
to .75 of an inch long,
instead of 1.25 to
1.75, or about the
amount on the second feather of northern specimens, as shown in the
accompanying figures. There is apparently a greater tendency to dusky
streaks and specks in the rufous of the side of the breast or in the adjacent
white. Resident specimens from Georgia are intermediate in size and color
between the northern and Florida races.</p>

<p><!--131.png--><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 113]</span>
The bill of Mr. Maynard’s specimen is about the size of that of more
northern ones; the iris is described by him as pale yellowish-white, much
lighter than usual.</p>

Similar to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. arcticus</i> in amount of white on the wings and scapulars,
though this frequently edged with black, but
without basal white on outer web of primaries.
Outer edge of outer web of external
tail-feather white, sometimes confluent with
that at tip of tail. Concealed white spots on
feathers of side of neck. Claws enormously
large, the hinder longer than its digit; the
hind toe and claw reaching to the middle of the middle claw, which, with its toe, is as
long as or longer than the tarsus. Inner lateral claw reaching nearly to the middle of
middle claw. Length, 7.60; wing, 3.25; hind toe and claw, .90. <i class="sex">Female</i> with the deep
black replaced by dusky slaty-olive.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Southern coast of California and across through valleys of Gila and Rio Grande;
north through the Great Basin across from Fort Crook, California, to Fort Bridger,
Wyoming.</p>

<p>This form constitutes so strongly marked a variety as to be worthy of
particular description. The general appearance is that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. arcticus</i>, which
it resembles in the amount of white spotting on the wings. This, however,
does not usually involve the whole outer web at the end, but, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oregonus</i>,
has a narrow border of black continued around the white terminally and
sometimes externally. There is not quite so much of a terminal white
blotch on the outer tail-feather, this being but little over an inch in length,
and the outer web of the same feather is never entirely white, though always
with an external white border, which sometimes is confluent with the
<!--132.png--><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 114]</span>
terminal spot, but usually leaves a brown streak near the end never seen in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arcticus</i>, which also has the whole outer web white except at the base.
From <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oregonus</i> the species differs in the much greater amount of white on
the wings and the less rounded character of the spots. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Oregonus</i>, too, has
the whole outer web of external tail-feather black, and the terminal white
spot of the inner web less than an inch in length. We have never seen in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oregonus</i> any concealed white spotting on the sides of the head.</p>

<p>The greatest difference between this race and the two others lies in the
stout tarsi and enormously large claws, as described, both the lateral extending
greatly beyond the base of the middle one, the hinder toe and claw
nearly as long as the tarsus. The only North American passerine birds
having any approach to this length of claw are those of the genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerella</i>.</p>

<p>This great development of the claws is especially apparent in specimens
from the Southern Sierra Nevada, the maximum being attained in the Fort
Tejon examples; those from as far north as Carson City, <abbr title="Nevada">Nev.</abbr>, however,
are scarcely smaller. In most Rocky Mountain Pipilos, the claws are but
little longer than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arcticus</i>.</p>

<p>In this race the female is not noticeably different from the male, being of
a merely less intense black,&mdash;not brown,&mdash;and conspicuously different as in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arcticus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oregonus</i>; there is, however, some variation among individuals
in this respect, but none are ever so light as the average in the other races.</p>

<p>The young bird is dusky-brown above, with a slight rusty tinge, and
obsolete streaks of blackish. White markings as in adult, but tinged with
rusty. Throat and breast rusty-white, broadly streaked with dusky; sides
only tinged with rufous.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> According to Mr. Ridgway’s observations, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. megalonyx</i>
replaces in the Rocky Mountain region and in the greater portion of the
Great Basin the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. arcticus</i> of the Plains, from their eastern slope eastward
to the Missouri River, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. oregonus</i> of the Northern Sierra Nevada
and Pacific coast. It is most nearly related to the latter. He became
familiar with the habits of this species near Salt Lake City, having already
made like observations of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oregonus</i> at Carson. A short acquaintance
with the former, after a long familiarity with the latter, enabled him to note
a decided difference in the notes of the two birds, yet in their external
appearance they were hardly distinguishable, and he was at first surprised
to find the same bird apparently uttering entirely different notes, the call-note
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. megalonyx</i> being very similar to that of the common Catbird.
The song of this species, he adds, has considerable resemblance in style to
that of the eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. erythrophthalmus</i>, and though lacking its musical
character, is yet far superior to that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. oregonus</i>. This bird is also much
less shy than the western one, and is, in fact, quite as unsuspicious as the
eastern bird.</p>

<p>Nests, with eggs, were found on the ground, among the scrub-oaks of the
hillsides, from about the 20th of May until the middle of June.</p>

<p><!--133.png--><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 115]</span>
This species has been obtained on the southern coast of California, and
through to the valleys of the Gila and the Rio Grande. In California it
was obtained near San Francisco by Mr. Cutts and Mr. Hepburn; at Santa
Clara by Dr. Cooper; at Monterey by Dr. Canfield; in the Sacramento
Valley by Dr. Heermann; at San Diego by Dr. Hammond; at Fort Tejon
by Mr. Xantus; at Saltillo, Mexico, by Lieutenant Couch; in New Mexico
by Captain Pope; and at Fort Thorn by Dr. Henry.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Couch describes it as a shy, quiet bird, and as found in woody
places.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly met with this bird at Pueblo Creek, New Mexico, January
22, 1854. It first attracted his attention early in the month of January, in
the Aztec Mountains, along Pueblo Creek. There it was often met with,
but generally singly. It inhabited the thickest bushes, and its motions were
so constant and rapid, as it hopped from twig to twig, that they found it
difficult to procure specimens. Its flight was rapid, and near the ground.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper speaks of this species as a common and resident bird in all the
lower districts of California, and to quite a considerable distance among the
mountains. It was also found on the islands of Catalina and San Clemente,
distant sixteen miles from the mainland. Though found in New Mexico,
Dr. Cooper has met with none in the barren districts between the Coast
Range and the Colorado, nor in the valley of the latter.</p>

<p>Their favorite residence is said to be in thickets and in oak groves, where
they live mostly on the ground, scratching among the dead leaves in the
concealment of the underbrush, and very rarely venturing far from such
shelter. They never fly more than a few yards at a time, and only a few
feet above the ground. In villages, where they are not molested, they soon
become more familiar, take up their abodes in gardens, and build their nests
in the vicinity of houses.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper gives them credit for little musical power. Their song is said
to be only a feeble monotonous trill, from the top of some low bush. When
alarmed, they have a note something like the mew of a cat. On this account
they are popularly known as Catbirds. He adds that the nest is made
on the ground, under a thicket, and that it is constructed of dry leaves,
stalks, and grass, mingled with fine roots. The eggs, four or five in number,
are greenish-white, minutely speckled with reddish-brown, and measure
one inch by .70.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found this species a very abundant and resident species in
Arizona. It was rather more numerous in the spring and in the fall than at
other times. He found it shy and retiring, and inhabiting the thickest brush.
Its call-note is said to be almost exactly like that of our eastern Catbird.
He describes its song as a rather harsh and monotonous repetition of four or
six syllables, something like that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Euspiza americana</i>. He found
females with mature eggs in their ovaries as early as May 5.</p>

<p>A nest of this species, collected by Mr. Ridgway near Salt Lake City,
<!--134.png--><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 116]</span>
May 26, was built on the ground, among scrub-oak brush. It is a very slight
structure, composed almost entirely of coarse dry stems of grass, with a few
bits of coarse inner bark, and with a base made up wholly with the latter
material, and having a diameter of about four inches.</p>

<p>The eggs of this nest, four in number, have an average measurement of .95
of an inch in length by .73 in breadth. Their ground-color is crystalline-white,
covered very generally with spots and small blotches of purplish and
wine-colored brown, somewhat aggregated at the larger end.</p>

Upper surface generally, with the head and neck all round to the upper

parts pure white, except the sides of the body
and under tail-coverts, which are light chestnut-brown;
the latter rather paler. The outer webs of
scapulars (usually edged narrowly with black) and
of the superincumbent feathers of the back, with a
rounded white spot at the end of the outer webs
of the greater and middle coverts; the outer edges of the innermost tertials white; no
white at the base of the primaries. Outer web of the first tail-feather black, occasionally
white on the extreme edge; the outer three with a white tip to the inner web. Outer

<p>Comparing this race with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arcticus</i>, we do not find much difference in the
white of the scapular region, except that
the white marks here, as elsewhere on the
wing, are rounded, the extreme end of the
outer web of the feather being black instead
of running out acutely white to the
very tip of the outer webs of the feathers.
This gives rather less extension to the
white. In fact, most of the white marks
are edged externally with black, converting
them into spots. There is no white whatever at the exposed base of the
<!--135.png--><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 117]</span>
outer web of the second to fifth primaries, and there is only a trace of white
near the end, instead of having a conspicuous white edging from base to
near the tip.</p>

<p>The outer web of the outer tail-feather, instead of being entirely white
for the exposed portion, is only very slightly edged with white; usually
entirely black. The white at the end of the feathers is much more restricted,
and extends only over the three outer feathers; usually not reaching to the
shaft. The relations to <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">megalonyx</i> have been given under the latter head.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Oregon Ground Robin, so far as known, has a restricted
residence, the western portion of Oregon and Washington Territory during
the summer, and in the more northern portions of California. Its occurrence
in the latter State seems to have escaped the notice of Dr. Cooper, though
he gives it conjecturally, having seen birds which he supposed to be of this
species in the higher Sierra Nevada. In its habits and notes Dr. Cooper
could observe no difference between this species and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. megalonyx</i>, both having
the complaining <i class="birdcall">mew</i>, from which they have obtained the name of Catbird
on that coast.</p>

<p>Mr. J. K. Lord found a nest containing six eggs, which he supposed to belong
to a bird of this species, at Fort Colville. It was built on the top of
a stump, round which young shoots had grown like a fringe, completely hiding
it from the sharpest eye. Mr. Hepburn met with it at Victoria.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper, in his Report on the Birds of Washington Territory, states
that the song of this species in spring, as it sits on a low bush enjoying the
sunshine, is like the final trill of the Redwing, or the lisping faint notes of
the Cowbird. It is a constant resident of the Territory, but only frequents
the edge of the coast in winter. He also mentions finding it about thirty
miles south of San Francisco in autumn. Dr. Suckley met with it west
of the Cascade Mountains.</p>

<p>In very many respects, in the opinion of Mr. Ridgway, the Oregon Ground
Robin very closely resembles the common and familiar eastern “Chewink.”
There is noticeable in this western representative a peculiar manner of flight,
and a predilection for bushy places, closely corresponding with those of the
eastern bird. It differs, in the most marked manner, however, in its extreme
shyness, and in the total absence of the agreeable and striking notes of the
Towhee. The notes of this bird are, he states, of the rudest description,
and instead of being familiar and unsuspicious, it is one of the shyest and
most difficult to approach of any of the western birds.</p>

<p>He found it quite plentiful about Sacramento, where it inhabits the thickets
in company with the western Chat. After crossing the Sierra Nevada it
was found more abundant still in the chaparrals of the sheltered ravines on
the eastern base of those mountains, as well as in the shrubbery of the river
valleys. During the winter it forsakes the former for the latter localities.
Eastward this species was found as far as the West Humboldt Mountains,
where typical examples were obtained.</p>

<p><!--136.png--><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 118]</span>
At Carson City, early in March, his attention was attracted by the peculiar
notes of this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilo</i>; the bird was sitting on a high rock above the thick
chaparral of the hillside, and sharply defined against the sky. It was readily
distinguishable by the black of its head and breast, in sharp contrast with
the pure white of its lower parts. Every few moments it would raise its head
to utter, in a short trill, its rude song. When approached, it would jerk
its expanded white-tipped tail, and disappear among the bushes. It was
abundant in the chaparrals, on the hillsides, and among the thickets and
buffalo-berry bushes along the rivers. The males were in full song, perching,
as they sang, on a prominent rock or bush.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall met with a nest of this species on the 14th of June. It was
built in the shelter of a low undershrub, in a depression scratched out for its
reception. It was made of a rather copious lining of clean wiry grass, with
some dead leaves beneath, as a foundation. The eggs were four, nearly
hatched, very closely resembling those of the Towhee, thickly spotted over,
but more so at the larger end, with very small round and very numerous
reddish-chocolate spots. The pair showed great solicitude about their nest,
the male, in particular, approaching boldly to scold and lament at the dangerous
intrusion.</p>

<p>The Oregon Ground Robin Mr. Lord considered a quaint and restless
bird. He found it very abundant from the coast to the summit of the Rocky
Mountains, and also very common on Vancouver Island. It arrives the last
of April and first of May, and frequents dark woods and thick tangled
underbrush. He describes it as stealthy and shy, with a habit of hiding,
but its cry usually betrays its place of concealment. This cry he states to
be like the squall of the Catbird.</p>

<p>Mr. Townsend found it abundant on the Columbia, where, as he observed,
it lived mostly on the ground, or on bushes near the ground, rarely ascending
trees. Mr. Audubon gives the measurement of its egg as 1.12 inches in
length and .87 in breadth.</p>

<p>The egg of this species is more rounded than are those of this genus generally,
and there is but little difference between the two ends. The ground-color
is white, with a greenish tinge, and is very generally and profusely
spotted with fine markings of reddish and purplish-brown. They measure
.95 by .80 of an inch.</p>

Upper parts generally, with head and neck all round to the upper part of
the breast, black; the rump usually tinged with ashy. Middle of breast and of belly
white; sides chestnut; under tail-coverts similar, but paler. Entire outer webs of
scapulars and of dorsal feathers immediately above them, and of ends of primary and
secondary coverts, to the shaft, with edges of outer webs of three innermost tertials, and
of the second to the fifth primaries, conspicuously white. Whole outer web of the first
and ends of the first to the fourth tail-feathers, white, the amount diminishing not very
rapidly. Outermost quill longer than ninth, sometimes than eighth, nearly always
exceeding the secondaries; third quill longest; fourth scarcely shorter. Length about
8 inches; wing, 4.40; tail, 4.10; hind toe and claw, .74. <i class="sex">Female</i> paler brown instead of
black; the rufous, seen in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. erythrophthalmus</i>, tinged with ashy.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
High central plains of Upper Missouri, Yellowstone, and Platte; basin of

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. arcticus</i> is similar in form to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. erythrophthalmus</i>, which, however,
is readily distinguished by the entire absence of white on the scapulars and
wing-coverts. The amount of white on the tail decreases much less rapidly.
The differences between it and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. oregonus</i> will be found detailed under the
head of the latter species.</p>

<p>One specimen (8,193) from Fort Leavenworth, with a few white spots only
on the scapulars, may perhaps be considered a hybrid between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arcticus</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">erythrophthalmus</i>.</p>

<p>In some specimens the interscapulars are edged externally with white.
The feathers of throat and sides of head show occasional concealed spots
of white about the middle. As in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">erythrophthalmus</i>, the bases of the
primaries are white along the outer edge, showing under the primary coverts,
sometimes, but perhaps not generally, confluent with the white towards the
end of the same web.</p>

<p>The female is of a dull ashy-brown, difficult to describe, but with only a
slight tinge of the rufous seen in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. erythrophthalmus</i>, which is most distinct
on top of head and back. There is an almost inappreciable ashy
superciliary stripe.</p>

<p>The young bird resembles in general appearance that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">megalonyx</i>, but is
lighter colored, and with the dusky streaks on the jugulum much narrower.
The brown above is as light as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">erythrophthalmus</i>, but without the reddish
cast seen in the latter, and not blackish, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">megalonyx</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Saskatchewan or Arctic Ground Finch was first met with by
Sir John Richardson. It was observed by him only on the plains of the
Saskatchewan, where he had no doubt of its breeding, as one specimen was
<!--138.png--><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 120]</span>
killed late in July. It was said to arrive in that region in the end of May,
and to frequent shady and moist clumps of wood. It was generally seen
on the ground. Its habits, so far as they were observed, correspond with
those of the Towhee Bunting, which it closely resembles in external appearance.
It feeds on grubs, and is a solitary and retired, but not a distrustful
bird.</p>

<p>Besides its occurrence in the Valley of the Saskatchewan, these birds have
often been found on the high central plains of the Upper Missouri, on
the Yellowstone and Platte Rivers. Audubon met with it at Fort Union.
Dr. Hayden obtained it on the Yellowstone, in August; at Fort Lookout,
June 22; at Bijou Hills, from May 1 to the 15th; at Bon Homme Island,
May 9. Dr. Cooper obtained it at Fort Laramie in September. Mr. Allen
found it in Colorado, where it was more abundant on the foothills than on
the plains. He also found this species an abundant inhabitant of the thickets
in the valley of the Great Salt Lake, in its habits strongly resembling
the common birds of the Eastern States. Though its song is also somewhat
similar, its call-note, he adds, is totally different, very nearly resembling that
of the Catbird.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse met with but few of these birds either in the Indian Territory
or in New Mexico. Mr. Dresser, in November, 1863, when hunting
in the Bandera Hills, noticed several of these birds near the camp, and obtained
several near San Antonio during the winter. None of these birds
appear to have been observed in the Arctic regions beyond the Saskatchewan
Plains.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall met with this species on the western slopes of the Rocky
Mountains, but as he apparently did not appreciate the difference between
this form and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oregonus</i>, we cannot determine with certainty to which his
descriptions apply in all cases. He found it, in manners and habits, the
counterpart of our common eastern species, frequenting forests and scratching
among the dead leaves among bushes and thickets. He describes it as
more shy than the common species. If the nest be invaded, the male shows
more boldness, and reiterates his complaints until the cause of his alarm is
removed. He speaks of its warble as quaint and monotonous, and very

of lavender and neutral tints, that the ground can hardly be distinguished.</p>

Above dark olive-brown, the crown with a very slight tinge of scarcely
appreciable dark rufous. Under parts with the color somewhat similar, but of a lighter
<!--141.png--><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 123]</span>
shade, and washed with grayish; middle of the belly only whitish; the under tail-coverts
pale rufous, shading into lighter about the vent and sides of lower belly; chin and throat
well-defined pale rufous, margined all round by brown spots, a few of them scattered
within the margin. Eyelids and sides of head, anterior to the eye, rufous like the throat.
One or two feathers on the lower part of the breast with a concealed brown blotch.
Outer primary not edged with white. Fifth quill longest; first shorter than ninth, or
even than secondaries. Bill pale brown, darker above; legs light. Length, 8.50 inches;
wing, 4.00; tail, 4.60.</p>

<p class="small"><span class="sc">Hab</span>. Coast region of California.</p>

<p>The bill is sinuated, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. aberti</i>, differing from that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. erythrophthalmus</i>.</p>

<p>This race is very similar to the original <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. fuscus</i> of Mexico, the original
description of Swainson answering almost exactly. It is, however, considerably
larger; the proportions of wing are similar; and there is no decided indication
of whitish in the middle of the body beneath, such as is always
distinctly appreciable in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscus</i>, and still more in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mesoleucus</i>.</p>

<p>A young bird differs but little from the adult except in having obsolete
dusky streaks below; the upper parts are uniform.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Brown, or Cañon Finch of California is found nearly
throughout the State of California. Mr. Xantus obtained it at Fort Tejon,
and Mr. Ridgway observed it among the chaparrals on the foothills of the
western slope of the Sierras.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper considers the name of Cañon Finch ill applied to this species,
as it is equally plentiful in level districts, wherever trees and shrubbery
exist. He regards it as one of the most abundant and characteristic
birds of California, residing in all the lower country west of the Sierras, and
extending up the slopes of the Coast Range to the height of three thousand
feet. They are said to have habits very similar to those of all the other
species, living much upon the ground, and seeking their food among the
<!--142.png--><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 124]</span>
dead leaves, which they greatly resemble in color. This resemblance Dr.
Cooper regards as a great protection to them from Hawks; their hues also
correspond with those of the earth and the dusky foliage during most of the
year. They are thus less conspicuous in the light, and they venture more
fearlessly forth and feed in open grounds.</p>

<p>They have but little song, and only utter a few faint chirps and hurried
notes, as they sit perched upon some low bush, in the spring. At San Diego
Dr. Cooper saw the first nest with eggs on April 17, but some birds had laid
much earlier, as he found young hatched by the 20th. He afterwards observed
other nests, all of which were built in bushes, from two to four feet from the
ground, and all but one contained three eggs; the other had four. He has
found them built in low trees, and one in a vine growing over the porch of a
house. The nest is formed of coarse twigs, bark, and grass, is thick and
large, and is lined with fine root-fibres and finer grasses. The eggs are pale
blue, spotted with purplish-brown blotches, mostly small and scattered. He
gives the measurement of the eggs as .90 by .65 of an inch. In the more
northern part of the State they are said to lay four eggs oftener than three.
They are supposed by him to have two broods in a season.</p>

<p>Colonel McCall has no doubt that they are found throughout California,
as he has met with them from the upper waters of the Sacramento to the
mouth of the Gila; the former having its origin in the extreme north, and
the latter touching the extreme southern boundary of the State. It is most
abundant south of Santa Barbara.</p>

<p>Colonel McCall states that its habits and manners differ somewhat from
those of the common Towhee and the Arctic Finches. Its flight is more
even and regular, and is without that violent jerking of the tail from side to
side, which gives such a singular appearance of awkwardness to the movements
of the Towhee. It is less shy and suspicious than the Arctic. It is
also much less decidedly a Ground Finch than either of the others. Its favorite
abode he found to be the vicinity of watercourses, where it is generally
to be seen in pairs, though he has, at times, surprised eight or ten
together under the shade of a large bush at noon in a summer day, when he
has had no difficulty in procuring three or four specimens before the party
dispersed. It is at all times a familiar bird, boldly coming into the roads to
feed, and permitting a close approach. If compelled to retreat, it darts suddenly
into the thicket, but returns as soon as the cause of alarm has disappeared.
Near Santa Barbara he found thirty or forty of these birds, in the
month of July, dispersed over an old field of some five acres in extent, contiguous
to a sea-beach, through which flowed a small stream of fresh water.
They were feeding on the ground, sheltered by a rank growth of weeds.
When one was flushed it flew into a neighboring tree instead of seeking
shelter again in the weeds. The young at that time were fully fledged, and
scarcely differed in the color of their plumage from the adults.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann once met with a nest of this bird built in a grapevine overhanging
<!--143.png--><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 125]</span>
the Sacramento River. He describes the eggs of this species as
differing entirely from any of this genus he had ever met with, and as having
so great a resemblance to the eggs of the three different species of Blackbirds
inhabiting California that they were liable to be confounded with
them unless marked when taken from the nest.</p>

<p>Dr. Newberry, who found this bird very common in the Sacramento Valley,
states that when he first met with it, a strange bird to him, its habit of
scratching among the dry leaves under the bushes, as well as its long tail
and jerking flight from one clump of bushes to another, at once indicated to
him its affinities.</p>

<p>Among the memoranda made by Mr. Xantus at Fort Tejon are the following
in reference to this species: “474, nest and two eggs, found May 19
on a small thorn-bush in a very dark thicket, about six feet from the ground;
1,675, nest and one egg, on a thick thorny bush, six feet from the ground;
1,851, nest and two eggs, May 12, on a rose-bush, four feet from the ground,
eggs already incubated.”</p>

<p>The eggs of this species measure one inch by .75, have a light ground of
robin-blue, and are spotted and blotched with varying shades of dark and
light purple. In some the color of the blotches is so deep as not to be
distinguishable from black, except in a strong light. The lighter shades
are a faint lavender.</p>

Above very dull olivaceous-brown, with a grayish tinge; hood dull chestnut,
conspicuously different from the back. Sides like the back, but paler; posteriorly,
and about the vent and under tail-coverts, pale brownish-red. The ashy olive-brown of
the sides scarcely meeting across the breast, the lower portion of which, with the upper
belly, is rather pure white. The loral region, chin, throat, and upper part of the breast,
pale yellowish-rufous, finely spotted on the sides and more coarsely across the breast with
brown; an obscure spot in the middle of the breast; edge of outer primary white. Bill
pale brown; legs flesh-color; first quill about equal to eighth, third and fourth longest.
Length, 8.50 inches; wing, 3.80; tail, 4.70.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Valley of Upper Rio Grande and across to the Gila River. East to Santa
Caterina, New Leon.</p>

<p>This race is similar in general appearance to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. crissalis</i>, but the
olive-brown and rufous are both of a lighter shade. The crown is of a
decided rufous, conspicuously different from the back, instead of nearly the
same tint. The light reddish under the head is wider throughout, and
<!--144.png--><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 126]</span>
extends down to the upper part of the breast, blending with the colors of
the breast and belly, instead of being narrower, more sharply defined, and
restricted to the chin and throat; it is palest anteriorly, the chin and lore
being almost white. The isolated larger spot on the breast is more conspicuous;
the breast and belly are quite pure white, shaded with obsolete
brownish blotches, instead of being uniform grayish-brown, with only an
approach to whitish in the very middle. The edges of the wing and tail
feathers are a good deal lighter, the outer web of the first primary being
sharply edged with pure white, instead of obscure grayish-brown. The size
generally is rather smaller, the wings more pointed.</p>

<p>Compared with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. fuscus</i>, we find the tail decidedly longer; the wing
more pointed; the first quill about equal to the eighth, instead of shorter
than the secondaries. The colors generally are paler; the cap of head bright
distinct rufous in strong contrast with the other plumage, instead of being
only very obscurely tinged with that color. The white of belly is purer, and
extends farther forward, displacing the ashy tinge almost to the buff of the
throat.</p>

<p>If we consider all the brown <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilos</i> as modifications of one primitive
species, it will be well to consider the Arizonan and New Mexican bird as
the central figure around which the others are grouped. The common character
will then be varied in the California race, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crissalis</i>, by the absence of
decided rufous on crown, a darker shade of color, and an extension of the
gray of sides over the whole under parts, almost entirely displacing the
white. The wing is more rounded, and the general dimensions larger southward
on the central plains of Mexico; the general tints are almost precisely
as in the California bird, except that the white of belly is very evident; but
the chestnut cap and extended whiteness of belly, together with the pointed
wing of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mesoleucus</i>, are wanting. In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. albigula</i> of Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas we have
the general characters of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mesoleucus</i>, with paler colors, more restricted spots
encircling throat, and a tendency to white in its lower part. In this it
approaches <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">albicollis</i> of Southwestern Mexico.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits</span>. This little-known form was first obtained by Dr. Kennerly, naturalist
to the Pacific Railroad Expedition on the 35th parallel, under Lieutenant
Whipple. He met with it at Bill Williams Fork, in Arizona, February
5, 1854. It was described by Professor Baird the following June. Dr. Kennerly
furnished at the time no information in regard to its habits.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann, in his Report on the birds observed in Lieutenant Parke’s
expedition, mentions having met with this species in the vicinity of Tucson.
Its habits, so far as he could judge of them from his opportunities, appeared
very similar to those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilo aberti</i>.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Couch met with this species at Santa Catalina, Mexico, in
April, 1853, but furnishes no information in reference to its manners. Mr.
J. H. Clark, who obtained a specimen near the Copper Mines of the Mimbres,
states that they were met with in abundance in the deep valleys or
<!--145.png--><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 127]</span>
cañons of that region. They were almost always in or about the thick
clumps of bushes, several usually being in company.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly, who met with them on a second trip, in June, 1855, near Los
Nogales, in Mexico, speaks of them as not very common in that region. He
found them preferring the dense bushes in the valleys. When approached,
they became very restless, flying from one bush to another, accompanying
their motions with very peculiar notes, which he does not describe.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found this species abundantly distributed throughout the
warmer portions of New Mexico and Arizona, from the valley of the Rio
Grande to that of the Colorado. He did not observe any at Fort Whipple,
though they were found breeding some twenty-five miles to the southward.
He found them associating freely with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilo aberti</i>, and inhabiting the same
regions. The two birds have very similar habits.</p>

<p>Dr. Henry also states that this species is common in New Mexico both
summer and winter, and, so far as he has observed, dwelling almost entirely
among the mountains. It appeared to him very retiring in its habits, and
seemed to prefer the cañons. He has seldom, if ever, observed it far from
shady gorges, where, like its relative of the Eastern States, the Towhee
Bunting, it passes the greater part of its time on the ground, and is generally
accompanied by its congener, the Arctic Finch. When disturbed, it
seeks the thickest cover, though it is by no means shy or difficult to approach.
Its nest is usually constructed in the branches of a thick cedar or dwarf oak,
and he has never known it to produce more than one brood in a season.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper states that these birds are very abundant in Southern Arizona,
that their habits closely resemble those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. aberti</i>, and that their eggs are
similar to those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilo fuscus</i>.</p>

Similar to <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mesoleucus</i>, having, like it, a distinctly rufous crown and
white abdomen. Differing, however, in the following respects: The pale ochraceous
gular area is more sharply defined, the buff being confined within the encircling series
of dusky spots; the buff is palest posteriorly, instead of directly the opposite. The
rufous of the crissal region is more restricted, only tingeing the anal region instead of
invading the lower part of the abdomen, the white beneath also is shifted farther back,
covering the abdomen alone, instead of the breast, the whole jugulum being distinctly
ashy, like the sides. Wing, 3.80; tail, 4.25.</p>

<p><!--146.png--><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 128]</span>
<span class="sc">Habits.</span> The White-throated or Cape Towhee of Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas was first
met with by Mr. Xantus in the southern extremity of the peninsula of
Lower California, and described by Professor Baird in 1859. Its close resemblance
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. mesoleucus</i> suggests an equal similarity as to its habits, in
regard to which we possess no actual knowledge. Mr. Xantus has furnished
us with no memoranda as to the manners of the bird. We have only
the brief mention among his notes to the effect that <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 4,855 is the nest
with four eggs of this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilo</i>, found in a wild <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Humulus</i>
thicket; and that <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr>
5,076 is a nest with eggs of the same, found in a thicket of wild roses in
the garden fence.</p>

<p>Judging from the large number of the nests and eggs of this species
collected by that gentleman at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, it would seem to be very
abundant in that locality.</p>

<p>The eggs of this variety measure .95 of an inch in length and .72 in
breadth. They bear a strong resemblance to those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. fuscus</i>, but the
markings are darker and more distinctly defined, standing out with a clear
and striking effect, in marked contrast with the light background. The
ground-color of the egg is a light tint of robin-blue. The markings of dots,
dashes, and lines are all about the larger end, and are of a deep dark shade
of purplish-brown, so dark as, except in a strong light, to be undistinguishable
from black.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Specific Characters"><span class="sc">Sp. Char.</span></abbr>
General color of upper parts pale brownish yellowish-red; beneath brighter,
and more ochraceous, especially on the under
coverts, palest on the middle of the belly.
Sides of head anterior to eyes, and chin dark
brown. Bill and legs yellowish. Length, 9
inches; wing, 3.70; tail, 4.85.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Base of Rocky Mountains in New
Mexico. Valley of Gila and Colorado.</p>

<p>This plainly colored bird is perhaps the largest of the North American
Finches, and is without any blotches, spots, or variations of importance from
one color, except on the chin and sides of the head. The bill is similar to
that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. erythrophthalmus</i>, but the cutting edge is less concave and more
<!--147.png--><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 129]</span>
sinuated. The tail is more graduated; the claws thicker and stronger. The
wings are short and much rounded; the first quill shorter than the secondaries;
fifth and fourth longest.</p>

<p>It may be easily distinguished from all the varieties of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscus</i> by the
blackish lores and chin, as well as by the absence of any colored gular area,
there being, instead, a pinkish rufous tinge prevalent over the whole throat
and jugulum. There are no dusky spots across the throat as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Dr. Cooper assigns the base of the Rocky Mountains, in New
Mexico, and the valleys of the Gila and Colorado Rivers, as the habitat of
this species. Dr. Coues speaks of it as one of the most abundant and characteristic
birds of those two valleys, and adds that it ranges northward to
within a few miles of Fort Whipple, but is not found in the adjacent mountains.
It was common at Fort Mohave, and particularly so at Fort Yuma.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly met with it at Camp <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 114, New Mexico, February 6, and
again at Bill Williams Fork, February 12. He states that while travelling
down the Big Sandy Creek and Bill Williams Fork, in the month of February,
he found them very abundant. They confined themselves to the
thick bushes near the water. Generally two or three were seen together.
Their motions were very rapid, and their note was a peculiar, loud, chattering
sound, sharp but not disagreeable. After leaving the Great Colorado he did
not see it again.</p>

<p>On the borders of the Gila, east of Fort Yuma, Dr. Heermann found this
bird in great abundance. It kept in the close sheltered thickets, where,
secure from intrusion, it sought among the dead leaves for various seeds and
insects and their larvæ, on which it feeds. In its habits it very much resembles
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilo fuscus</i>, or Cañon Finch, diving into the bushes when
alarmed, and repeating, at intervals, a short chirp. After leaving the Gila
River he did not meet with any more, as he followed no longer the course
of any large stream, for the borders of which these birds seem to have a
decided preference.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper regards this species as the almost exact counterpart of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilo fuscus</i>. The only difference he noticed in habits was in the character
of its loud note of alarm, remarkably similar, however, to that of two very
distinct birds of the same valley, namely, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centurus uropygialis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phainopepla
nitens</i>. Like the Cañon Finch, this species is said to live almost constantly
on the ground, but appears rather more gregarious, especially in
winter.</p>

<p>About the first of April Dr. Cooper met with many of their nests. They
were generally built in thorny shrubs, and were composed of a flooring of
coarse twigs, or of green herbs, and strongly interwoven with strips of bark,
grass, and leaves. One bird had taken advantage of the recent introduction
of horses into the valley to obtain a lining of horse-hair for its nest. The
eggs were in all cases only three, bluish-white, with brown spots and streaks
in a ring near the large end, quite variable in number, and measuring one
<!--148.png--><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 130]</span>
inch by .70. One of the nests was in a low mesquite-tree, another in a dense
cluster of dead twigs hanging from a cottonwood. The time required for
hatching was twelve or thirteen days, and in a fortnight more the young left
the nest. Dr. Cooper found nests with eggs as late as May 25, and had no
doubt that they raise two or more broods in a season. He adds that the
song of the male, throughout April and May, is precisely like that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. fuscus</i>,
and also reminded him of the notes of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. oregonus</i> and of the eastern
Black-throated Bunting (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Euspiza americana</i>).</p>

<p>Dr. Coues has kindly supplied me with the following interesting sketch of
this species, as observed by him in Arizona:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“This species appears to have a remarkably restricted geographical distribution.
I never saw it at Fort Whipple, but on the Colorado bottom in the
same latitude, and thence along the river to Fort Yuma, I found it to be one
of the most abundant and characteristic birds of all. At the time I observed
it, in September, it was generally in small flocks, and proved rather difficult
to capture, partly because the dense underbrush it inhabited was almost impenetrable,
and partly on account of its natural timidity. Everything along
the river-bottom is scorched with the heat, and the dry dead twigs constantly
snap at a touch, with such noise that it is almost impossible to force a passage
through the underbrush without alarming all its inmates. The bird
occurs everywhere along the river-side, but is particularly numerous on the
patches of mesquite, and the extensive areas grown up to young willows and
cottonwoods, and the arrowwood (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tessaria borealis</i>). Its ordinary cry of
alarm, if not its call-note, is a loud, clear chirp, very different from the mewing
sound made under similar circumstances by its congener, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. megalonyx</i>.
The latter, as is well known, is almost exactly like that of a Catbird.
I never heard the song of this bird, which appears to sing only during the
breeding-season, but Dr. Cooper says it resembles that of the western Black
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilos</i>, and I can indorse his observation, that this is curiously like the monotonous
notes of the Black-throated Bunting,&mdash;<i class="birdcall">Chip, chip, chee-chee-chee</i>;
the first two syllables deliberately pronounced, the others more rapidly enunciated,
with greater emphasis. The associates of this species seem to be few,
if indeed they be not confined to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. mesoleucus</i>, a very near ally. The
moult seems to me unusually protracted, as many September specimens were
still in poor plumage.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Excepting my experience with this bird on the Colorado, I only met with
it on the Hassayampa, a small stream a few miles from Fort Whipple, yet in
a somewhat different region, across a slight mountain-ridge, lower and warmer.
Two specimens were secured, adult and young, the first week in August.”</p>

<p>Dr. Coues, on his way from Arizona to the Pacific (Ibis, 1866, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 261),
mentions that he was often startled by the loud, clear, sharp chirp of this
bird, which, though fringilline in character, is more than usually powerful,
and is its alarm-note. Everywhere in the Colorado Valley this was one of
the most characteristic birds. Fort Yuma seemed to be its head-quarters. It
<!--149.png--><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 131]</span>
is, like all its congeners, a retiring species, and keeps perseveringly in the
almost impenetrable undergrowth. It is said to be more decidedly gregarious
than most of the genus, often collecting in flocks of a dozen or more,
wandering restlessly, yet in a cautious manner, through the thickets.</p>

<p>A nest with eggs, procured at Fort Mohave by Dr. Cooper, is in the Smithsonian
Collection (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 7,276). The egg measures .93 by .70 of an inch, is
obovate in shape, being much rounded at the smaller end. Its ground-color
is a dull white, without any perceptible tinge of blue,&mdash;though possibly
bluish when fresh,&mdash;with heavy dots and occasional delicate, hair-like,
zigzag markings of black. These markings are wholly confined to the
larger end. One of the eggs has these markings much finer, consisting of
minute dots, more dense, and upon the apex of the larger end. The nest is
loosely built and very bulky. Its external diameter is about six inches, and
its depth three. The cavity is three inches wide and two deep. It is constructed
almost entirely of strips of inner bark, the coarser, ribbon-like
pieces being used on the outer portion, and the finer shreds composing the
lining. Externally are also a few sticks about one quarter of an inch in
diameter.</p>

Above dull grayish olive-green. Crown uniform chestnut. Forehead with
superciliary stripe, and sides of the head and neck, the upper part of the breast and sides
of the body, bluish-ash. Chin and upper part of throat abruptly defined white, the former
margined by dusky, above which is a short white maxillary stripe. Under tail-coverts
and sides of body behind brownish-yellow. Tail-feathers generally, and exterior of wings,
bright olive-green, the edge and under surface of the wings bright greenish-yellow; edge
of first primary white. First quill longer than eighth, fourth longest. Length, about 7
inches; wing, 3.20; tail, 3.65.</p>

<p>In this species the wing is considerably rounded, the tertials considerably
shorter than the primaries, and not exceeding the secondaries; the fourth
quill longest, the first shorter than the sixth, the second and fifth quills
<!--150.png--><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 132]</span>

<p>The extent of the chestnut
of the crown varies somewhat;
more extended probably in the
males. The region on the side
of the head, adjoining the
nostrils, is whitish; the small
feathers under the eye are
spotted with the same. The
posterior outline of the ash of
the breast is much less sharply
defined than the anterior.</p>

<p>Specimens vary in the
brightness of the olive above,
which is never as pure as that
of the wings and tail. The olive of the tail, too, is darker than that of the

<p>A very young bird (1,896) has the whole under parts dull white, streaked
and spotted on the sides of the throat and on the breast with dark brown.
The crown and back are also thickly spotted. In 5,734 the ash of the breast
has made its appearance; the middle of the belly is white, spotted;
the chin white, encircled by
spots. The spots above are restricted
to near the head, and
there is a small central patch
of chestnut on the crown.</p>

<p><abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1,896 is the original
“Green-tailed Sparrow” killed
July 12, 1834, by Townsend,
and described in an extract of a
letter to Mr. Audubon, published
page 336 of <abbr title="Volume Five">Vol. V.</abbr> of the Ornithological
Biography.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits</span>. Dr. Kennerly, who procured a specimen of this bird at San Elizario,
Tex., December 16, states that it was obtained with some difficulty. For
several successive days it was found in the same place, occupying a small
clump of very thick weeds. When aroused, which was only accomplished with
some effort, its flight was short, rapid, and decidedly irregular. Its motions
on the ground were very awkward. This species was found by Mr. Ridgway
very generally distributed throughout the fertile mountain portions of
the interior. It was not seen by him in California, and was first met with
in the ravines at the base of the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada. On the
<!--151.png--><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 133]</span>
high mountain-ranges it was a characteristic and the best-known singer, as
well as one of the most abundant of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fringillidæ</i>, being found in all
bushy places, from the bases to the summits of the mountains. It is exclusively
a summer species, arriving at Carson City about the middle of April.
He describes the usual note of this bird as very peculiar, and, as nearly as
can be described, a sweet laughing utterance of the syllables <i class="birdcall">keek-keek´</i>, a
little resembling the <i class="birdcall">tweet</i> of a Canary, but very musical. This curious note
was generally uttered when anything unusual attracted its attention, such as
the approach of an intruder. Then, with elevated tail and its very conspicuous
red cap raised, it would hop familiarly and unsuspiciously about. He
adds that it is a songster of high merit, in power and variety ranking very
little below the song of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chondestes grammaca</i>. The song varies in the
modulations greatly with the individual, but the same general style is preserved.
At times it seemed to have a slight resemblance to the song of
Bewick’s Wren, and at others to that of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanospiza</i>, and more rarely, to
be the reproduction of a passage from the song of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chondestes</i>.</p>

<p>In the early part of July, near Austin, in the cañons of the mountains, he
found these birds breeding in the greatest abundance, and later in the same
month a few of its nests were found on the East Humboldt Mountains. All
of its nests, with hardly an exception, were placed from eighteen inches to
two feet above the ground, among the thick bushes of a species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Symphoricarpus</i>,
or “snow-berry,” which grows in great abundance upon the sides of
the cañons of those mountains. The maximum number of eggs was four.
It was also quite a common bird in the Wahsatch Mountains, though less
abundant than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. megalonyx</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen found this Finch quite numerous in Colorado Territory, and
speaks of its song as very peculiar and very pleasing. It is said to resemble
in no respect the eastern Towhee Finch, with which it is classed, but much
more closely the group of Sparrows, so familiarly represented at the east
by the White-throated, being like them in habits, song, and general aspect.
It was more common among the foot-hills than on the plains. In Utah,
according to Mr. Allen, this Finch begins to appear in numbers about September
20, from its breeding-haunts in the mountains.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues met with this species in Arizona, but only as a spring and autumn
migrant. None remained there in summer to breed, and none were
found there in the winter. In its migrations it passed rapidly by Fort
Whipple, being found there only during the latter part of April and the
beginning of May, and during the month of September. At those seasons
it appeared to him the most silent and retiring of all the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilos</i>. He found
it very difficult to either observe its habits or to capture it. It winters
sparingly at Fort Mohave.</p>

<p>Specimens of this bird were taken near Lookout Mountain by C. S. McCarthy,
and at Gilmer, in Wyoming Territory, by Mr. Durkee.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann, in his Report on the birds observed on the <abbr title="thirty-second">32d.</abbr> parallel,
<!--152.png--><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 134]</span>
under Lieutenant Parke, mentions first meeting with this species near Tucson.
They were frequenting, in numbers, the thick undergrowth, and were
seeking seeds and insects on the ground. They seemed inclined to shun
observation, and always kept in the most retired situations. They were
sociable among themselves, going about singly or in pairs, associated with
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Poospiza bilineata</i> and two or three other kinds of Finch. When started
they fly low, diving into the bushes, and soon disappear from sight. Occasionally,
until reaching El Paso, Texas, birds of this species were met with,
mingling with the flocks of migrating <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fringillidæ</i>. He there procured a pair
apparently just entering upon incubation.</p>

<p>Instead of being suited by color, like most of the other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilos</i>, to inhabit
dark thickets and among dry leaves, this species is clad in a gayer livery, and
seems well adapted for concealment in its summer resorts, and also among
the growing vegetation of the lower country during the rainy season. Dr.
Heermann found a few wintering in the Colorado Valley, and yet more at
San Diego, but they left both places in March. He found them silent and
shy, hiding very closely in the bushes, and feeding altogether on the ground.
The only note he heard, resembled the crowing note of the California Quail.</p>

<p>Among the memoranda of Mr. Xantus, made near Fort Tejon, are the two
following: “4,839, nest and two eggs (of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilo chlorurus</i>) found in a dry
hedge in Mr. Ritchie’s garden; 5,083, nest and eggs found in a dark garden-hedge.”</p>

<p>The eggs of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chlorurus</i> are like those of no other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilo</i> that I have
met with. They are peculiar in shape, being nearly of an exact oval, neither
end being apparently much more rounded than the other. Their ground-color
is white with a bluish tint, over which is profusely diffused a cloud of
fine dottings of a pinkish-drab. These markings are occasionally so fine and
so thickly distributed as to give to the egg the appearance of a uniform
color, or as an unspotted pinkish drab-colored egg. Occasionally the dots
are deeper and larger, and more sparsely diffused.</p>

<p>In considering the eggs of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilos</i> in general we find certain variations
which deserve more than a passing notice. Those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">erythrophthalmus</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">oregonus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arcticus</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">megalonyx</i> are all fringilline in their characters, and
have a marked affinity to eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melospiza, Zonotrichia</i>, and many other
genera of this order. The eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aberti, fuscus, mesoleucus</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">albigula</i> are
also all closely alike, and exhibit a very close resemblance to those of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agelaii</i>, and even of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Icteri</i>, while the eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. chlorurus</i>, though of a
fringilline character, are unlike either style.</p>

with the plates nearly of corresponding position and number. Hind claw very long
and nearly straight. Bill short, conical, frontal feathers extending along side of the bill;
the nostrils concealed by a tuft of bristly feathers directed forward. Tertials greatly
elongate beyond the secondaries.</p>

<p class="centerindent"><b class="species-and-varieties">Subfamilies and Genera.</b></p>

<p class="indent1"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alaudinæ.</b> Bill stout, short, and conical; nasal fossæ transverse and completely
filled by the thick tuft of bristly feathers, and perforated anteriorly by a circular
nasal opening. (Old and New World.)</p>

<p class="indent2">Crown with a depressed soft crest of feathers, of normal structure; a spurious
primary; tail deeply emarginate<span class="lock"> … </span><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alauda</i>.</p>

rounded<span class="lock"> … </span><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eremophila</i>.</p>

<p class="indent1"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calandritinæ.</b> Bill broader, more depressed, and straighter at the base; nasal
fossæ longitudinal, large, elongated, the nasal opening rather linear. (Old World.)</p>

<p>Of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alaudidæ</i> only the two genera diagnosed above belong to the
American continent; and one of them is properly only a wanderer from the
Old World, while the other is cosmopolitan.</p>

<p>The most characteristic feature of the Larks among other oscine families
is seen in the scutellation of the tarsus. The anterior half of this is covered
by divided scales lapping round on the sides, but instead of the two
plates which go one on each side of the posterior half and unite ultimately
behind as an acute ridge, there is but one which laps round on the sides,
and is divided into scales like the anterior ones, but alternating with them.
The posterior edge of the tarsus is as obtuse as the anterior, instead of
being very acute. There is a deep separating groove on the inner side of the
tarsus; and there may be really but one plate divided transversely, the edges
meeting at this place.</p>

<p>In the elongated hind claw and lengthened tertials, general style of coloration,
mode of life, and manner of nesting, there is a decided approximation
in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Alaudidæ</i> to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthinæ</i>, of the family <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Motacillidæ</i>; but in these
the posterior edge of the tarsus is sharp and undivided transversely, the toes

Europe; accidental in Greenland and the Bermudas; Aleutian Islands.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The famed Skylark of the Old World can rest a twofold claim
to be included in a complete list of North American birds. One of these is
their occasional occurrence in the Bermudas, and in Greenland. The other
is their probably successful introduction near New York.</p>

<p>A few years since an attempt was made to introduce these birds, for
which purpose several individuals were set at liberty on Long Island. For a
short time they did well, and succeeded in raising one or more broods, but,
owing probably to the constant persecution of all small birds by the foreign
population of the neighborhood, the experiment nearly failed, and none were
noticed in that vicinity. Within the last year or two, however, several
pairs of these birds have been observed in Westchester County, and also on
Long Island, by parties competent to recognize them, and hopes are now entertained
that these desirable birds have obtained a foothold in this country.</p>

<p><!--155.png--><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 137]</span>
According to Messrs. Dresser and Sharpe, the Skylark is found throughout
the polar Arctic regions, from the British Islands eastward to Siberia and
Northern China. A smaller subspecies is met with in Southeastern Europe,
which does not present any character by which it can be separated
from it. In Eastern Europe the Lark has been found as far north as the
Faroe Islands, but has not been observed in Iceland. It reaches Christiania
in March, and leaves in October. It has been found breeding in Lapland as
far north as latitude 65<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, and is a common summer visitant in Finland.
Pallas found it abundant throughout Russia and Siberia, and Steller found
it not only in Kamtschatka, but equally in the Kurile Islands and in those
between Asia and America, so that its occurrence in our Alaskan territories
may be regarded as a not improbable event.</p>

<p>The same writers also state that the Skylark has been twice recorded as
occurring in Greenland and in America; and in another place they state that
“the Skylark occasionally visits Greenland, and has been met with in the
Bermudas.” In the latter place a storm-tried waif was taken by Mr. J. M.
Jones after an easterly gale.</p>

<p>The Lark is a universal favorite in the Old World, and as a vocalist enjoys
a reputation hardly second even to the far-famed Nightingale. It is an inhabitant
of all the countries of Europe, and is said to be most abundant in
the cultivated districts.</p>

<p>We only know of its song from caged specimens and from the testimony
of European writers. Yarrell speaks of its notes as cheerful and exhilarating,
fresh as the season of spring, and the admiration of all hearers. Its
voice is described as powerful to an extraordinary degree, and its song
wild and joyous. They sing while they fly, rising, with quivering wings
almost perpendicularly, until they gain so great an elevation that they can
no longer be distinguished; yet, while thus no longer visible, their wild
music continues to be heard as that of some unseen spirits of the air. It is
said that one familiar with their song can readily determine, by their notes,
whether the singer is ascending, stationary, or descending. Occasionally,
when at this great elevation, the Lark will close its wings and drop to the
earth with the rapidity of a stone. At times it will sing while on the
ground, but its most lively strains are poured forth during these flights.
And though this bird will sing while in confinement, and is a favorite cage-bird,
yet in singing they are said to flutter their wings, as if this motion were
almost a necessary accompaniment to their song.</p>

<p>In regard to the song and its peculiarities writers are not quite in agreement.
The general opinion seems to be that, while in the quality of its
tone it is surpassed by the song of the Nightingale, the Bulfinch, and the
Black-cap, it is unequalled in quantity, sprightliness, variety, and power.
The Lark is in song eight months of the year, and during the summer
months it sings from two in the morning, with very little intermission, until
after sunset.</p>

<p><!--156.png--><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 138]</span>
Mr. Macgillivray gives an excellent and graphic description of the habits of
this bird, from which we extract a portion descriptive of its song. “It has
been alleged,” he writes, “that the Lark ascends in a spiral manner, but my
observation does not corroborate the statement. In rising it often passes directly
upward, but with the body always horizontal, or nearly so, then moves
in a curve, and continues thus alternately, but without a continued spiral motion.
At first, the motion of the wings is uniformly fluttering; but afterwards
it shoots them out two or three times successively at intervals, and when at
its greatest height exhibits this action more remarkably. When it descends,
the song is not intermitted, but is continued until it approaches the ground,
when it usually darts down headlong, and alights abruptly. Frequently it
resumes its song after alighting, and continues it for a short time, but more
commonly it stops when it has reached the ground. Often a Lark may be
seen hovering over a field, in full song, for a considerable time, at a small
height. On the 4th of May, 1837, I observed a Lark perched on a half-burnt
whin branch, where it remained singing a long time. I have often
seen it perch on a wall, and several times on a hawthorn bush in a hedge;
but it never, I believe, alights on tall trees.</p>

<p>“The song of the Lark is certainly not musical, for its notes are not finely
modulated, nor its tones mellow; but it is cheerful and cheering in the highest
degree, and protracted beyond all comparison. In a sunny day in April
or May, when the grass-fields have begun to resume their verdure, it is
pleasant to listen to the merry songster that makes the welkin ring with its
sprightly notes; in the sultry month of July, still more pleasant is it to
hear its matin hymn while the dew is yet on the corn; and in winter, should
you chance to hear the well-known voice on high, it reminds you of the
bright days that have gone, and fills you with anticipation of those that are
to come. No doubt much of the pleasure derived from the Lark’s song depends
upon association, but independently of circumstances and associations
the song of the Lark imparts an elasticity to the mind, elevates the spirits,
and suspends for a time the gnawing of corroding care. The carol of the
Lark, like the lively fife, excites pure cheerfulness. In confinement this
bird sings every whit as well as when at large, and when rapidly perambulating
the square bit of faded turf in its cage, it enacts its part with apparently
as much delight as when mounting toward heaven’s gate.”</p>

<p>This bird succeeds well in cages, and lives to a great age, Yarrell mentioning
one that lived nearly twenty years in confinement. Its natural food is
grain, the seeds of grasses, worms, and various kinds of insects. They begin
to mate in April, and have two broods in a season. Their nest is always
placed on the ground, often sheltered by a tuft of grass, or some other protection.
The nests are woven of coarse grasses and stems of plants, and
are lined with finer materials of the same. The eggs are five in number,
have a grayish-white ground, occasionally a greenish-white, very generally
sprinkled and blotched with markings of dark-gray and an ashy-brown, so
<!--157.png--><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 139]</span>
profusely as to conceal the ground. They are oval in shape, slightly more
pointed at one end, and measure .93 of an inch in length by .70 in breadth.</p>

<p>According to Selby, the young of the first brood are fully fledged by the
end of June, and the second in August. The Lark evinces a very strong
attachment to its young, and many interesting accounts are given by
European writers of its intelligent endeavors to conceal and to protect its
nest,&mdash;in one instance constructing an artificial dome of dry grass, where
the natural protection had been cut away by mowers, and in another
attempting to remove the young to a place of greater safety.</p>

<p>The Lark has, in several instances, been successfully induced to mate and
rear her young in an aviary; and Mr. W. P. Foster, of Hackney, is quoted
by Mr. Yarrell as authority for the statement, that, during the period of producing
the eggs, the female has been heard to sing with a power and a variety
of tone equal to the voice of her mate.</p>

<p>While his mate is sitting on her eggs, the male Lark, apparently timid at
all other times, is remarkably bold, and drives away other birds that venture
too near their nest. He not only watches over her and seeks to protect her,
but assiduously supplies her with food.</p>

white on the coverts. The blackish areas are but faintly indicated by a dusky suffusion,
generally very indistinct, across the breast, and over the cheeks; and variegated with
badly defined, more dusky spots; lower parts, including post-ocular stripe, dull white;
sides spotted with dusky.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. alpestris</i>, as restricted, is represented in the collection by three
perfect specimens, in the several stages of plumage described; while there
is also a fine specimen from Astrachan, representing a white-throated race
(“<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bei</i>” on <abbr title="manuscript">MS.</abbr> label) of Central Asia. The series of American specimens
is all that could possibly be desired, there being numerous examples from
nearly the whole northern continent, from the Arctic regions to as far south
as Bogota, and from coast to coast.</p>

<p>The common Shore Lark of the northern parts of North America appears
to be absolutely identical with the European bird, each of the specimens of
the latter being easily matched from the American series. It therefore
becomes necessary to reduce the name “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cornuta</i>” to a synonyme of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alpestris</i>,
<!--162.png--><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 142]</span>
the former not affording characters to distinguish it as even a variety. To
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alpestris</i> may also be referred the form known as “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">occidentalis</i>, McCall,” those
specimens from the interior regions which are destitute of any yellow tinge
on the throat. Were this feature a constant one in specimens from the
region which it characterizes, it would be, of course, right to retain the name
in the form of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alpestris</i> <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">occidentalis</i>. As it is, however, quite a large
percentage of the specimens from every locality where <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">occidentalis</i> is found
have more or less yellow throats, but it is possible that this mixture of the two
may be the result of irregular migrations, those yellow-throated individuals
being stragglers from their breeding habitat,&mdash;more to the eastward and
northward. In its white instead of straw-yellow throat, and more lilaceous
than vinaceous upper parts, this form bears a close resemblance to a race of
the deserts of Western (and Central?) Asia,&mdash;the “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bei</i>”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_26" id="fnanchor_26"></a><a href="#footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></span>;
the latter,
however, has these features more exaggerated than in the one of the central
plains of North America. Breeding throughout the table-lands of Mexico,
and in the Western Province of the United States, north to about the 40th
parallel, is a more strongly marked race, maintaining also more constancy
in its peculiar features; this race is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. chrysolæma</i>, <abbr title="Wagler">Wagl.</abbr>, of which
name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rufa</i>, <abbr title="Audubon">Aud.</abbr>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minor</i>, Giraud, are synonymes. This race, which we
propose to call <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. alpestris</i> <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chrysolæma</i>, differs from both the northern
styles in smaller size and longer bill, and in coloration is the opposite extreme
from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">occidentalis</i>, having the vinaceous tints deeper and browner,
instead of paler and less brown, than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cornuta</i> (i. e. typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alpestris</i>).
The black markings are also more extended, in proportion to the other colors,
reducing the white on the forehead to a very narrow band, instead of a broad
spot equalling, or exceeding, the black in width. Specimens from Bogota&mdash;about
the southern limit of the genus on this continent&mdash;are, perhaps,
referrible to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chrysolæma</i>, or at least not very different from it, though described
by Sclater as distinct, under the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peregrinus</i>.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_27" id="fnanchor_27"></a><a href="#footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></span></p>


<p>In fewer words, the variations, with the region, are about as follows.
Starting with North America, north of the United States, we begin with a style
absolutely undistinguishable from that of Europe; this, to which the name
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cornuta</i> belongs, visits the Eastern States only in winter, but breeds over the
prairie region of Wisconsin, Illinois, and westward. West of the Rocky
Mountains, especially south of about 40<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, specimens referrible to this style
are most numerous in winter, and in a large series a great percentage of the
specimens entirely lack any yellow on the throat, while the pinkish-brown
tints are lighter and less reddish; this style represents, in these peculiar features,
the “var. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bei</i>” of Western Asia (Astrachan), and has been distinguished
by the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">occidentalis</i>, McCall, though it is doubtful whether McCall’s
description is of a specimen of this style or of one of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chrysolæma</i>, being
<!--163.png--><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 143]</span>
taken from a young or immature bird. Breeding south of about 40<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, from
the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific coast, and throughout the table-lands of
Mexico,&mdash;in winter sometimes resident at the northern limit assigned, and
there mixed with northern-bred individuals,&mdash;is a kind which is smaller,
and, generally, with a larger bill; the throat is deeper yellow than in the
northern form, the pinkish tints deepened into cinnamon, and the frontal
band narrower, caused by an encroachment of the black, which, in its several
areas, is extended more in proportion to the other colors. This is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E.
chrysolæma</i> of Wagl., and of which <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minor</i>, Giraud, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rufa</i>, Aud., are synonymes,
as already stated.</p>

<p>Along the coast of Oregon and Washington Territory is a very peculiar
race, represented in the collection by several specimens. These differ essentially
in having the dark streaks above very sharply defined, broad and clear
blackish-brown,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_28" id="fnanchor_28"></a><a href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></span>
while the lower parts are strongly tinged with yellow, even
as deeply so as the throat. Additional specimens from the northwest coast
may establish the existence of a race as distinct as any of those named
above.</p>

Middle America, from the desert regions of the southern Middle Province of
North America, south to Bogota.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Assuming the Shore Lark of the Labrador coast and the rufous
Lark of the Western prairies to be one and the same species, but slightly
modified by differences of locality, climate, or food, we have for this species,
at all times, a wide range, and, during the breeding-season, a very unusual
peculiarity,&mdash;their abundant distribution through two widely distant and
essentially different regions.</p>

<p>During a large portion of the year, or from October to April, these birds
may be found in all parts of the United States. Dr. Woodhouse found them
very common throughout Texas, the Indian Territory, New Mexico, and California.
Mr. Dresser states that he found the western variety&mdash;which he
thinks essentially different in several respects from the eastern&mdash;in great
numbers, from October to the end of March, in the prairies around San
Antonio. Afterwards, at Galveston, in May and June, 1864, he noticed and
shot several specimens. Although he did not succeed in finding any nests,
he was very sure that they were breeding there. It is common, during winter,
on the Atlantic coast, from Massachusetts to South Carolina. In Maine
it is comparatively rare. In Arizona, Dr. Coues speaks of the western form
as a permanent resident in all situations adapted to its wants. The same
writer, who also had an opportunity of observing the eastern variety in
Labrador, where he found it very abundant on all the moss-covered islands
around the coast, could notice nothing in their voice, flight, or general manners,
different from their usual habits in their southern migrations, except
that during the breeding-season they do not associate in flocks.</p>

<p>Richardson states that this Lark arrives in the fur countries in company
with the Lapland Bunting, with which it associates, and, being a shyer bird,
would act as sentinel and give the alarm on the approach of danger. As Mr.
<!--165.png--><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 145]</span>
Dall only obtained a single skin on the Yukon, it probably is not common
there. Dr. Suckley states it to be a very abundant summer resident on the
gravelly prairies near Fort Steilacoom, in Washington Territory. He describes
it as a tame, unsuspicious bird, allowing a man to approach within a few feet
of it. It is essentially a ground bird, rarely alighting on bushes or shrubs.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper adds to this that the Shore Lark is common in the interior, but
he only noticed one on the coast border. In ordinary seasons they seem to
be permanent residents, and in winter to be both more gregarious and more
common. He met with one as late as July 1, on a gravelly plain near
Olympia, scratching out a hollow for its nest under a tussock of grass.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper also found these birds around Fort Mohave in considerable
flocks about the end of February, but all had left the valley by the end of
March. About May 29 he found numbers of them towards the summits of
the Providence range of mountains, west of the valley, and not far from four
thousand feet above it, where they probably had nests. They were also
common in July on the cooler plains towards the ocean, so that they doubtless
breed in many of the southern portions of California, as well as at
Puget Sound and on the Great Plains. Dr. Cooper states that in May or
June the males rise almost perpendicularly into the air, until almost out of
sight, and fly around in an irregular circle, singing a sweet and varied song
for several minutes, when they descend nearly to the spot from which they
started. Their nests were usually found in a small depression of the ground,
often under a tuft of grass or a bush. Mr. Nuttall started a Shore Lark from
her nest, on the plains, near the banks of the Platte. It was in a small depression
on the ground, and was made of bent grass, and lined with coarse
bison-hair. The eggs were olive-white, minutely spotted all over with a
darker tinge.</p>

<p>According to Audubon, these Larks breed abundantly on the high and
desolate granite tracts that abound along the coast of Labrador. These
rocks are covered with large patches of mosses and lichens. In the midst
of these this bird places her nest, disposed with so much care, and the moss
so much resembling the bird in hue, that the nests are not readily noticed.
When flushed from her nest, she flutters away, feigning lameness so cunningly
as to deceive almost any one not on his guard. The male at once joins
her, and both utter the most soft and plaintive notes of woe. The nest is
embedded in the moss to its edges, and is composed of fine grasses, circularly
disposed and forming a bed about two inches thick. It is lined with the
feathers of the grouse and of other birds. The eggs, deposited early in July,
are four or five in number, and are described by Mr. Audubon as marked
with bluish as well as brown spots.</p>

<p>About a week before they can fly, the young leave the nest, and follow
their parents over these beds of mosses to be fed. They run nimbly, and
squat closely at the first approach of danger. If observed and pursued, they
open their wings and flutter off with great celerity.</p>

<p><!--166.png--><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 146]</span>
These birds reach Labrador early in June, when the male birds are very
pugnacious, and engage frequently in very singular fights, in which often
several others besides the first parties join, fluttering, biting, and tumbling
over in the manner of the European House Sparrow. The male is described
as singing sweetly while on the wing, but its song is comparatively short. It
will also sing while on the ground, but less frequently, and with less fulness.
Its call-note is quite mellow, and is at times so altered, in a ventriloquial
manner, as to seem like that of another bird. As soon as the young are
hatched their song ceases. It is said to feed on grass-seeds, the blossoms
of small plants, and insects, often catching the latter on the wing, and
following them to a considerable distance. It also gathers minute crustaceans
on the sea-shore.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway found this species abundant over the arid wastes of the interior,
and, in many localities, it was almost the only bird to be found. In its
habits he could observe no differences between this bird and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alpestris</i>.
He met with their nests and eggs in the Truckee Reservation, June 3. The
nest was embedded in the hard, grassy ground, beneath a small scraggy sage-bush,
on the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mesa</i>, between the river and the mountains.</p>

<p>Mr. J. K. Lord mentions that, having encamped at Cedar Springs on the
Great Plains of the Columbia, where the small stream was the only water
within a long distance, he became interested in watching the movements of
these Larks. As evening approached they came boldly in among the mules
and men, intense thirst overcoming all sense of fear. He found these handsome
little birds very plentiful throughout British Columbia. They were
nesting very early on those sandy plains, even before the snow had left the
ground. He saw young fledglings early in May.</p>

<p>A single specimen of this species was taken at Godhaab, Greenland, in
October, 1835.</p>

<p>Eggs from Labrador are much larger in size than those from Wisconsin.
Two eggs from the first, one obtained by Mr. Thienemann, the other by Mr.
George Peck, of Burlington, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, measure .93 and .94 of an inch in length by
.71 in breadth; while some from the West are only .83 in length and .63
in breadth, their greatest length being .90, and their largest breadth .69 of
an inch. In their ground-color and markings, eggs from both localities vary
about alike. The ground-color varies from a purplish-white to a dark gray,
while the spots are in some a brownish-lavender, in others a brown, and,
quite frequently, an olive-brown. In some they are in larger, scattered
blotches; while in others they are in very fine minute dots so thickly and so
uniformly diffused as almost to conceal the ground.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agelainæ</i>, through <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molothrus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dolichonyx</i>, present a close relation

bill, and, in fact, it is very difficult to express in brief words the distinctions
which evidently exist. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dolichonyx</i> may be set aside as readily determinate
by the character of the feet and tail. The peculiar subfamily

<p>A female bird from Paraguay (<abbr title="December">Dec.</abbr>, 1859) is undistinguishable from the
average of northern ones, except by the smaller size. Specimens from the
western plains differ from those taken near the Atlantic Coast in having
the light areas above paler, and less obscured by the grayish wash so prevalent
in the latter; the ochraceous of the nape being very pale, and at the
same time pure.</p>

<p><!--170.png--><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 150]</span>
<span class="sc">Habits.</span> The well-known and familiar Bobolink of North America has,
at different seasons of the year, a remarkably extended distribution. In its
migrations it traverses all of the United States east of the high central plains
to the Atlantic as far to the north as the 54th parallel, which is believed to
be its most northern limit, and which it reaches in June. In the winter it
reaches, in its wandering, the West Indies, Central America, the northern
and even the central portions of South America. Von Pelzeln obtained
Brazilian specimens from Matogrosso and Rio Madeira in November, and
from Marabitanas, April 4th and 13th. Those procured in April were
in their summer or breeding plumage, suggesting the possibility of their
breeding in the high grounds of South America. Sclater received specimens
from Santa Marta and from Bolivia. Other specimens have been reported
as coming from Rio Negro, Rio Napo, in Brazil, Cuba, Jamaica, Porto Rico,
Paraguay, Buenos Ayres, etc.</p>

<p>In North America it breeds from the <abbr title="forty-second">42d</abbr> to the 54th parallel, and in
some parts of the country it is very abundant at this season. The most
southern breeding locality hitherto recorded is the forks of the Susquehanna
River, along the west branch of which, especially in the Wyoming Valley,
it was formerly very abundant.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway also observed this bird in Ruby Valley where, among the
wheat-fields, small companies were occasionally seen in August. He was
informed that, near Salt Lake City, these birds are seen in May, and again
late in the summer, when the grain is ripe.</p>

<p>Of all our unimitative and natural songsters the Bobolink is by far the
most popular and attractive. Always original and peculiarly natural, its
song is exquisitely musical. In the variety of its notes, in the rapidity with
which they are uttered, and in the touching pathos, beauty, and melody of
their tone and expression, its notes are not equalled by those of any other
North American bird. We know of none, among our native feathered songsters,
whose song resembles, or can be compared with it.</p>

<p>In the earliest approaches of spring, in Louisiana, when small flocks of
male Bobolinks make their first appearance, they are said, by Mr. Audubon,
to sing in concert; and their song thus given is at once exceedingly novel,
interesting, and striking. Uttered with a volubility that even borders upon
the burlesque and the ludicrous, the whole effect is greatly heightened by
the singular and striking manner in which first one singer and then another,
one following the other until all have joined their voices, take up the
note and strike in, after the leader has set the example and given the
signal. In this manner sometimes a party of thirty or forty Bobolinks will
begin, one after the other, until the whole unite in producing an extraordinary
medley, to which no pen can do justice, but which is described
as very pleasant to listen to. All at once the music ceases with a suddenness
not less striking and extraordinary. These concerts are repeated from
time to time, usually as often as the flock alight. This performance may
<!--171.png--><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 151]</span>
also be witnessed early in April, in the vicinity of Washington, the Smithsonian
grounds being a favorite place of resort.</p>

<p>By the time these birds have reached, in their spring migrations, the 40th
parallel of latitude, they no longer move in large flocks, but have begun to
separate into small parties, and finally into pairs. In New England the
Bobolink treats us to no such concerts as those described by Audubon,
where many voices join in creating their peculiar jingling melody. When
they first appear, usually after the middle of May, they are in small parties,
composed of either sex, absorbed in their courtships and overflowing with
song. When two or three male Bobolinks, decked out in their gayest spring
apparel, are paying their attentions to the same drab-colored female, contrasting
so strikingly in her sober brown dress, their performances are quite
entertaining, each male endeavoring to outsing the other. The female
appears coy and retiring, keeping closely to the ground, but always attended
by the several aspirants for her affection. After a contest, often
quite exciting, the rivalries are adjusted, the rejected suitors are driven
off by their more fortunate competitor, and the happy pair begin to put in
order a new home. It is in these love-quarrels that their song appears to
the greatest advantage. They pour out incessantly their strains of quaint
but charming music, now on the ground, now on the wing, now on the top
of a fence, a low bush, or the swaying stalk of a plant that bends with their
weight. The great length of their song, the immense number of short and
variable notes of which it is composed, the volubility and confused rapidity
with which they are poured forth, the eccentric breaks, in the midst of
which we detect the words “bob-o-link” so distinctly enunciated, unite to
form a general result to which we can find no parallel in any of the musical
performances of our other song-birds. It is at once a unique and a charming
production. Nuttall speaks of their song as monotonous, which is
neither true nor consistent with his own description of it. To other ears
they seem ever wonderfully full of variety, pathos, and beauty.</p>

<p>When their contests are ended, and the mated pair take possession of their
selected meadow, and prepare to construct their nest and rear their family,
then we may find the male bird hovering in the air over the spot where his
homely partner is brooding over her charge. All this while he is warbling
forth his incessant and happy love-song; or else he is swinging on some
slender stalk or weed that bends under him, ever overflowing with song and
eloquent with melody. As domestic cares and parental responsibilities increase,
his song becomes less and less frequent. After a while it has degenerated
into a few short notes, and at length ceases altogether. The young
in due time assume the development of mature birds, and all wear the sober
plumage of the mother. And now there also appears a surprising change
in the appearance of our gayly attired musician. His showy plumage of
contrasting white and black, so conspicuous and striking, changes with
almost instant rapidity into brown and drab, until he is no longer distinguishable,
either by plumage or note, from his mate or young.</p>

<p><!--172.png--><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 152]</span>
At the north, where the Bobolinks breed, they are not known to molest the
crops, confining their food almost entirely to insects, or the seeds of valueless
weeds, in the consumption of which they confer benefit, rather than harm.
At the south they are accused of injuring the young wheat as they pass
northward in their spring migrations, and of plundering the rice plantations
on their return. About the middle of August they appear in almost innumerable
flocks among the marshes of the Delaware River. There they are
known as Reedbirds. Two weeks later they begin to swarm among the
rice plantations of South Carolina. There they take the name of Ricebirds.
In October they again pass on southward, and make another halt among the
West India Islands. There they feed upon the seeds of the Guinea-grass,
upon which they become exceedingly fat. In Jamaica they receive a new
appellation, and are called Butterbirds. They are everywhere sought after
by sportsmen, and are shot in immense numbers for the table of the epicure.
More recently it has been ascertained that these birds feed greedily upon
the larvæ of the destructive cotton-worm, and in so doing render an immense
service to the cultivators of Sea Island cotton.</p>

<p>Dr. Bryant, in his visit to the Bahamas, was eye-witness to the migrations
northward of these birds, as they passed through those islands. He first
noted them on the 6th of May, towards sunset. A number of flocks&mdash;he
counted nine&mdash;were flying to the westward. On the following day the country
was filled with these birds, and men and boys turned out in large numbers
to shoot them. He examined a quantity of them, and all were males
in full plumage. Numerous flocks continued to arrive that day and the
following, which was Sunday. On Monday, among those that were shot
were many females. On Tuesday but few were to be seen, and on Wednesday
they had entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>Near Washington, Dr. Coues observed the Bobolink to be only a spring
and autumnal visitant, from May 1st to the 15th distributed abundantly
about orchards and meadows, generally in flocks. In autumn they frequented
in immense flocks the tracts of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zizania aquatica</i>, along the Potomac,
from August 20 to October.</p>

<p>The Bobolink invariably builds its nest upon the ground, usually in a
meadow, and conceals it so well among the standing grass that it is very
difficult of discovery until the grass is cut. The female is very wary in leaving
or in returning to her nest, always alighting upon the ground, or rising
from it, at a distance from her nest. The male bird, too, if the nest is approached,
seeks to decoy off the intruder by his anxiety over a spot remote
from the object of his solicitude. The nest is of the simplest description,
made usually of a few flexible stems of grasses carefully interwoven into a
shallow and compact nest. The eggs, five or six in number, have a dull
white ground, in some tinged with a light drab, in others with olive. They
are generally spotted and blotched over the entire egg with a rufous-brown,
intermingled with lavender. They are pointed at one end, and measure .90
by .70 of an inch. They have but one brood in a season.</p>

<p><!--173.png--><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 153]</span>
In some eggs, especially those found in more northern localities, the
ground-color is drab, with a strong tinge of purple. Over this is diffused a
series of obscure lavender-color, and then overlying these are larger and
bolder blotches of wine-colored brown. In a few eggs long and irregular
lines of dark purple, so deep as to be undistinguishable from black, are
added. These eggs are quite pointed at one end.</p>

Bill short, stout, about two thirds the length of head; the commissure
straight, culmen and gonys slightly

rounded, convex, and running back on
the head in a point. Lateral toes nearly
equal, reaching the base of the middle

chocolate-brown, rather lighter above; rest of body lustrous black, with a violet-purple
gloss next to the brown, of steel blue on the back, and of green elsewhere. Female light
olivaceous-brown all over, lighter on the head and beneath. Bill and feet black. Length,

<p>The young bird of the year is brown above, brownish-white beneath; the
throat immaculate. A maxillary stripe and obscure streaks thickly crowded
across the whole breast and sides. There is a faint indication of a paler
superciliary stripe. The feathers of the upper parts are all margined with
paler. There are also indications of light bands on the wings. These markings
are all obscure, but perfectly appreciable, and their existence in adult
birds of any species may be considered as embryonic, and showing an
inferiority in degree to the species with the under parts perfectly plain.</p>

<p>Specimens from the west appear to have a rather longer and narrower bill
than those from the east. Summer birds of Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas and the Rio
Grande are considerably smaller (<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obscurus</i>, Cassin). Length about 6.50;

in size to the average.</p>

<p>Birds of this species breeding south of the Rio Grande, as well as those
from Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, Mazatlan, etc., are very much smaller than those nesting
within the United States; but the transition between the extremes
of size is so gradual that it is almost impossible to strike an average

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Cow Blackbird has a very extended distribution
from the Atlantic to California, and from Texas to Canada, and probably to
regions still farther north. They have not been traced to the Pacific coast,
though abundant on that of the Atlantic. Dr. Cooper thinks that a few
winter in the Colorado Valley, and probably also in the San Joaquin Valley.</p>

<p>This species is at all times gregarious and polygamous, never mating, and
never exhibiting any signs of either conjugal or parental affections. Like
the Cuckoos of Europe, our Cow Blackbird never constructs a nest of her
own, and never hatches out or attempts to rear her own offspring, but imposes
her eggs upon other birds; and most of these, either unconscious of the
imposition or unable to rid themselves of the alien, sit upon and hatch the
stranger, and in so doing virtually destroy their own offspring,&mdash;for the
eggs of the Cowbird are the first hatched, usually two days before the others.
The nursling is much larger in size, filling up a large portion of the nest,
and is insatiable in its appetite, always clamoring to be fed, and receiving
by far the larger share of the food brought to the nest; its foster-companions,
either starved or stifled, soon die, and their dead bodies are removed, it is
supposed, by their parents. They are never found near the nest, as they
would be if the young Cow Blackbird expelled them as does the Cuckoo;
indeed, Mr. Nuttall has seen parent birds removing the dead young to a
distance from the nest, and there dropping them.</p>

<p>For the most part the Cowbird deposits her egg in the nest of a bird much
smaller than herself, but this is not always the case. I have known of their
eggs having been found in the nests of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus mustelinus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. fuscescens</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sturnella magna</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. neglecta</i>. In each instance they had been incubated.
How the young Cowbird generally fares when hatched in the nests of birds
of equal or larger size, and the fate of the foster-nurslings, is an interesting
subject for investigation. Mr. J. A. Allen saw, in Western Iowa, a female
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Harporhynchus rufus</i> feeding a nearly full grown Cowbird,&mdash;a very interesting
fact, and the only evidence we now have that these birds are reared
by birds of superior size.</p>

<p>It lays also in the nests of the common Catbird, but the egg never remains
there long after the owner of the nest becomes aware of the intrusion. The
list of the birds in whose nests the Cow Blackbird deposits her egg and it is
reared is very large. The most common nurses of these foundlings in New
England are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spizella socialis, Empidonax minimus, Geothlypis trichas</i>, and all
our eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireos</i>, namely, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">olivaceus, solitarius, noveboracensis, gilvus</i>, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flavifrons</i>. Besides these, I have found their eggs in the nests of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polioptila
cærulea, Mniotilta varia, Helminthophaga ruficapilla, Dendroica virens, D.</i>
<!--176.png--><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 156]</span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">blackburniæ, D. pennsylvanica</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. discolor, Seiurus aurocapillus, Setophaga
ruticilla, Cyanospiza cyanea, Contopus virens</i>, etc. I have also known of
their eggs having been found in the nests of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireo belli</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">V. pusillus</i>, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanospiza amœna</i>. Dr. Cooper has found their egg in the nest of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Icteria
virens</i>; and Mr. T. H. Jackson of West Chester, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>, in those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Empidonax
acadicus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyranga rubra</i>.</p>

<p>Usually not more than a single Cowbird’s egg is found in the same nest,
though it is not uncommon to find two; and in a few instances three and
even four eggs have been met with. In one instance Mr. Trippe mentions
having found in the nest of a Black and White Creeper, besides three eggs
of the owner of the nest, no less than five of the parasite. Mr. H. S. Rodney
reports having found, in Potsdam, <abbr title="New York"><span class="sc">N. Y.</span></abbr>, May 15, 1868, a nest of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Zonotrichia
leucophrys</i> of two stories, in one of which was buried a Cowbird’s egg,
and in the upper there were two more of the same, with three eggs of the
rightful owners. In the spring of 1869 the same gentleman found a nest of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sayornis fuscus</i> with three Cowbird’s eggs and three of her own.</p>

<p>Mr. Vickary, of Lynn, found, in the spring of 1860, the nest of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Seiurus
aurocapillus</i>, in which, with only one egg of the rightful owner, there were
no less than four of the Cowbird. All five eggs were perfectly fresh, and had
not been set upon. In the summer of the preceding year the same gentleman
found a nest of the Red-eyed Vireo containing three eggs of the Vireo
and four of the Cow Blackbird.</p>

<p>How the offspring from these eggs may all fare when more than one of
these voracious nurslings are hatched in the same nest, is an interesting
problem, well worthy the attention of some patiently inquiring naturalist to
solve.</p>

<p>The Cow Blackbird appears in New England with a varying degree of
promptness, sometimes as early as the latter part of March, and as frequently
not until the middle of April. Nuttall states that none are seen in Massachusetts
after the middle of June until the following October, and Allen,
that they are there all the summer. My own observations do not correspond
with the statement of either of these gentlemen. They certainly do become
quite rare in the eastern part of that State after the third week in June, but
that all the females are not gone is proved by the constant finding of freshly
laid eggs up to July 1. I have never been able to find a Cow Blackbird in
Eastern Massachusetts between the first of July and the middle of September.
This I attribute to the absence of sufficient food. In the Cambridge
marshes they remain until all the seeds have been consumed, and only reappear
when the new crop is edible.</p>

<p>This Blackbird is a general feeder, eating insects, apparently in preference,
and wild seed. They derive their name of Cow Blackbird from their keeping
about that animal, and finding, either from her parasitic insects or her
droppings, opportunities for food. They feed on the ground, and occasionally
scratch for insects. At the South, to a limited extent, they frequent
the rice-fields in company with the Redwinged Blackbird.</p>

<p><!--177.png--><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 157]</span>
Mr. Nuttall states that if a Cow Blackbird’s egg is deposited in a nest alone
it is uniformly forsaken, and he also enumerates the Summer Yellowbird as
one of the nurses of the Cowbird. In both respects I think he is mistaken.
So far from forsaking her nest when one of these eggs is deposited, the Red-eyed
Vireo has been known to commence incubation without having laid
any of her own eggs, and also to forsake her nest when the intrusive egg
has been taken and her own left. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. æstiva</i>, I think, invariably covers
up and destroys the Cowbird’s eggs when deposited before her own, and even
when deposited afterwards.</p>

<p>The Cow Blackbird has no attractions as a singer, and has nothing that
deserves the name of song. His utterances are harsh and unmelodious.</p>

<p>In September they begin to collect in large flocks, in localities favorable
for their sustenance. The Fresh Pond marshes in Cambridge were once
one of their chosen places of resort, in which they seemed to collect late in
September, as if coming from great distances. There they remained until
late in October, when they passed southward.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway only met with this species in two places, the valley of the
Humboldt in September, and in June in the Truckee Valley. Their eggs
were also obtained in the Wahsatch Mountains, deposited in the nest of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Passerella
schistacea</i>, and in Bear River Valley in the nest of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Geothlypis trichas</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Boardman informs me that the Cow Blackbird is a very rare bird in
the neighborhood of Calais, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr>, so much so that he does not see one of
these birds once in five years, even as a bird of passage.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are of a rounded oval, though some are more
oblong than others, and are nearly equally rounded at either end. They
vary from .85 of an inch to an inch in length, and from .65 to .70 in breadth.
Their ground-color is white. In some it is so thickly covered with fine dottings
of ashy and purplish-brown that the ground is not distinguishable. In
others the egg is blotched with bold dashes of purple and wine-colored
brown.</p>

<p>On the Rio Grande the eggs of the smaller southern race were found in
the nests of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireo belli</i>, and in each of the nests of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireo pusillus</i> found
near Camp Grant, Arizona, there was an egg of this species. At Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Lucas, Mr. Xantus found their eggs in nests of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Polioptila melanura</i>.
We have no information in regard to their habits, and can only infer that
they must be substantially the same as those of the northern birds.</p>

<p>The eggs of the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obscurus</i> exhibit a very marked variation in size from
those of the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pecoris</i>, and have a different appearance, though their colors
are nearly identical. Their ground-color is white, and their markings a
claret-brown. These markings are fewer, smaller, and less generally distributed,
and the ground-color is much more apparent. They measure
.60 by .55 of an inch, and their capacity as compared with the eggs of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pecoris</i> is as 33 to 70,&mdash;a variation that is constant, and apparently too large
to be accounted for on climatic differences.</p>

<p>There is some variation in the shade of red on the shoulders, which is
sometimes of the color of arterial blood or bright crimson. It never, however,
has the hæmatitic tint of the red in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. tricolor</i>. The middle coverts
are usually uniform brownish-yellow to the very tips; sometimes some of
these middle coverts are tipped at the end with black, but these black tips
are usually of slight extent, and indicate immaturity, or else a transition of
hybridism or race to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. gubernator</i>.</p>

<p>There is also some variation in the size and proportions of the bill. The
most striking is in a series of three from the Red River Settlement, decidedly
larger than more southern ones (wings, 5.15; tail, 4.40). The bill is about
as long as that of Pennsylvania specimens, but much stouter, the thickness
at the base being considerably more than half the length of the culmen.
One specimen from San Elizario, Texas, has the bill of much the same size
and proportions.</p>

<p>The male of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. assimilis</i> of Cuba cannot be distinguished from small-sized
males of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phœniceus</i> from the United States, the females, however, as in
nearly all West Indian <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Icteridæ</i>, are uniform though rather dull black. This
we consider as simply a local variation of melanism, not indicating a specific
difference. A young male is similar, but with the lesser coverts red, tipped
with black. On the other extreme, streaked female and young birds from
Lower California, Arizona, and Western Mexico are much lighter than in
eastern birds, the chin, throat, jugulum, and superciliary stripe tinged with
a peculiar peach-blossom pink; not buff, sometimes tinged with orange.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The much abused and persecuted Redwinged Blackbird is found
throughout North America as far north as the 57th parallel, from the Atlantic
to the Pacific; and it breeds more or less abundantly wherever found,
from Florida and Texas to the plains of the Saskatchewan. According to
the observations of Mr. Salvin, it is resident all the year in Guatemala. It
breeds among the reeds at the lake of Dueñas, deferring its incubation until
the month of June. The females congregate in large flocks near the lake,
feeding about the swampy grass on the edge of the water, the males keeping
separate. At Orizaba, Mexico, Sumichrast regarded this species as only a
bird of passage.</p>

<p>On the Pacific coast, it is only found, in any numbers, in Washington
Territory and in Oregon, about cultivated tracts. Dr. Cooper thinks that
none inhabit the bare and mountainous prairie regions east of the Cascade
Mountains. Small flocks wintered at Vancouver about stables and haystacks.
<!--183.png--><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 161]</span>
Dr. Suckley speaks of them as quite common west of the Cascade
Mountains, arriving from the South in March. In all the marshy places of
the entire West Mr. Ridgway met with this species and their nests in great
abundance. In all respects he found the western birds identical with the
eastern. Their nests were in low bushes in overflowed meadows.</p>

<p>Donald Gunn found this species common in the Red River Settlements;
and Richardson met with them on the Saskatchewan, where they arrive in
May, but do not breed until the 20th of June.</p>

<p>In New England this Blackbird is generally migratory, though instances
are on record where a few have been known to remain throughout the winter
in Massachusetts. They are among the earliest to arrive in spring,
coming, in company with the Rusty Grakle, as early as the 10th of March.
Those which remain to breed usually come a month later. They breed
throughout New England, as also in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>It is equally abundant and resident in Arizona and Texas, and in the adjoining
portions of Mexico. On the Rio Grande, Mr. Dresser found it very
abundant, breeding on the banks of the rivers and streams. In the winter
season these birds are found in immense flocks in the lower parts of Virginia,
both the Carolinas, and all the Gulf States, particularly near the sea-coast
and among old fields of rice and grain. Wilson states that once, passing, in
January, through the lower counties of Virginia, he frequently witnessed
the aerial evolutions of great bodies of these birds. Sometimes they appeared
as if driven about like an enormous black cloud carried before the
wind, varying every moment in shape. Sometimes they rose up suddenly
from the fields with a noise like thunder, while the glittering of innumerable
wings of the brightest vermilion, amid the black cloud, occasioned a very
striking effect. At times the whole congregated multitude would suddenly
alight in some detached grove and commence one general concert, that he
could plainly distinguish at the distance of more than two miles, and when
listened to at a distance of a quarter of a mile, the flow of its cadences was
grand, and even sublime.</p>

<p>He adds that with the Redwings the whole winter season seems one continued
carnival. They find abundant food in the old fields of rice, buckwheat,
and grain, and much of their time is spent in aerial movements, or
in grand vocal performances.</p>

<p>Early in March these large assemblies break up. A part separate in
pairs and remain among the Southern swamps. The greater portion, in
smaller flocks, the male bird leading the way, commence their movements
northward. Late in April they have all re-established themselves in their
chosen haunts, have mated, and are preparing to make their nests. In Pennsylvania
this is done in May, in New England early in June, and farther
north a fortnight later. For their nest they invariably select either the
borders of streams or low marshy situations. These they usually place in
low bushes, such as grow in moist situations, among thick bunches of reeds,
<!--184.png--><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 162]</span>
or even on the ground. In one instance, in an island on the marshes of
Essex River, Mr. Maynard found these nests placed in trees twenty feet
from the ground. One nest was built on a slender sapling at the distance of
fourteen feet from the ground. The nest was pensile, like that of the
Baltimore Oriole. It was woven of bleached eel-grass.</p>

<p>When built in a bush, the outer, basket-like frame of the nest is carefully
and strongly interwoven with, or fastened around, the adjacent twigs, and,
though somewhat rudely put together, is woven firmly and compactly.
Within this is packed a mass of coarse materials, with an inner nest of
sedges and grasses. The outer framework is usually made of rushes and
strong leaves of the iris. The male bird is a very attentive and watchful
parent, constantly on the lookout for the approach of danger, and prompt
to do all in his power to avert it, approaching close to the intruder, and
earnestly remonstrating against the aggression. If the nest is pillaged,
for several days he evinces great distress, and makes frequent lamentations,
but soon prepares to remedy the disaster. So tenacious are they of a selected
locality, that I have known the same pair to build three nests within
as many weeks in the same bush, after having been robbed twice. The
third time the pair succeeded in raising their brood.</p>

<p>In New England these birds have but one brood in a season. Farther
south they are said to have three or more. In August they begin to collect
in small flocks largely composed of young birds. The latter do not reach
their full plumage until their third summer, but breed in their immature
plumage the summer following their appearance. When the Indian corn is
in the milk, these birds are said to collect in numbers, and to commit great
depredations upon it. As soon, however, as the corn hardens, they desist
from these attacks, and seek other food. In the grain-growing States they
gather in immense swarms and commit great havoc, and although they are
shot in immense numbers, and though their ranks are thinned by the attacks
of hawks, it seems to have but little effect upon the survivors. These
scenes of pillage are, for the most part, confined to the low sections, near
the sea-coast, and only last during a short period, when the corn is in a condition
to be eaten.</p>

<p>On the other hand, these Blackbirds more than compensate the farmer for
these brief episodes of mischief, by the immense benefits they confer in the
destruction of grub-worms, caterpillars, and various kinds of larvæ, the
secret and deadly enemies of vegetation. During the months of March,
April, May, June, and July, their food is almost wholly insects, and during
that period the amount of their insect food, all of it of the most noxious
kinds, is perfectly enormous. These they both consume themselves and
feed to their young. Wilson estimated the number of insects destroyed
by these birds in a single season, in the United States, at twelve thousand
millions.</p>

<p>The notes of this bird are very various and indescribable. The most
<!--185.png--><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 163]</span>
common one sounds like <i class="birdcall">con-cur-ee</i>. But there is also an almost endless
mingling of guttural, creaking, or clear utterances that defy description.</p>

<p>Their eggs vary greatly in size; the largest measures 1.08 inches by .82 of
an inch, the smallest .90 by .65. They average about an inch in length and
.77 of an inch in breadth. They are oval in shape, have a light-bluish
ground, and are marbled, lined, and blotched with markings of light and
dark purple and black. These markings are almost wholly about the larger
end, and are very varying.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Specific Characters"><span class="sc">Sp. Char.</span></abbr>
Bill rather shorter than the head, without any longitudinal sulci, but with
faint traces of transverse ones at the base of the lower jaw. Tail rounded. First quill
nearly equal to the fourth.</p>

<p class="small"><i class="sex">Male.</i> Throughout of a lustrous velvety-black, with a greenish reflection. The lesser
coverts rich crimson; the middle coverts brownish-yellow at the base, but the exposed
portion black. Wing, 5.00; tail, 3.90; culmen, .90; tarsus, 1.10.</p>

<p class="small"><i class="sex">Female.</i> Nearly uniform dark slaty-brown; an indistinct superciliary stripe, an indication
of a maxillary stripe, and blended streaks on chin and throat delicate pale peach-blossom
pink, this on the jugulum interrupted by dusky streaks running in longitudinal
series; lesser wing-coverts tinged with dark wine-red. Wings with just appreciable
paler edges to the feathers. Wing, 4.20; tail, 3.20.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Pacific Province of United States, and Western Mexico, to Colima; Western
Nevada (<span class="sc">Ridgway</span>). ? Xalapa (<span class="sc">Sclater</span>, 1859, 365).</p>

<p>In the female and all the immature stages, the dusky beneath is largely
in excess of the light streaks; the superciliary light stripe is badly defined,
and there is no trace of a median light stripe on the crown. These characters
distinguish this race from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phœniceus</i>; while the rounded instead of
square tail, and brown instead of pure white border to middle wing-coverts,
distinguish it from corresponding stages of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tricolor</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Crimson-shouldered Blackbird was first met with by Mr.
Townsend, on the Columbia River, where two specimens were obtained,
which were described by Mr. Audubon, in his Synopsis, in 1839. No information
in regard to its habits, distribution, or nesting, was obtained by either
Mr. Townsend or by his companion, Mr. Nuttall.</p>

<p>This species, or local race, whichever it is considered, occurs from the Columbia
River south throughout California. It is given doubtingly as also
from the Colorado River, but Dr. Cooper was only able to detect there the
common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phœniceus</i>. According to the observations of that careful naturalist,
<!--186.png--><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 164]</span>
this species is chiefly found in the warmer interior of California, Santa
Cruz being the only point on the coast where he has met with it. He
found it in scattered pairs, in May, throughout the Coast Range, even to
the summits, where there are small marshes full of rushes, in which they
build. He has not been able to detect any difference between the habits
and notes of this bird and the common Redwing. The fact that specimens
with entirely red shoulders seem limited to the middle of the State, or are
rare along the coast, while most of those on the coast closely resemble the
eastern bird, Dr. Cooper regards as suggestive of its being only a local race,
though said to occur also in Mexico.</p>

<p>During the summer this species is said to emit a variety of sweet and
liquid notes, delivered from some tree near its favorite marsh. These are
also sometimes mingled with jingling and creaking sounds.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley, in his Report on the Zoölogy of Washington Territory, expresses
the opinion, that, although a specimen of this bird is reported as
having been taken by Townsend on the Columbia, it is very rarely found so
far north, as he never met with it in Washington Territory, and has never
been able to hear of any other specimen having been found there.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly, in his Report on the birds observed in the survey of the
35th parallel, states that during the march along Bill Williams Fork, and
along the Great Colorado and the Mohave Rivers, this species was found quite
numerous. They were more abundant still along the creeks and swampy
grounds that were passed as they approached the settlements of California.
Large flocks could there be seen whirling around in graceful curves, like dark
clouds, chattering joyfully as they moved along, or settling as a black veil on
the topmost branches of some tree, indulging loudly in their harsh music.</p>

<p>In his Report of the birds observed in the survey under Lieutenant Williamson,
Dr. Heermann mentions finding this species abundant, and, in the
fall season, as associated with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molothrus pecoris</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. tricolor</i>. Its nest he
found built in the willow bushes and tussocks of grass above the level of
the water, in the marshes. There were but a few pairs together, and in this
respect they differ from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tricolor</i>, which prefers dry situations near
water, and which congregate by thousands while breeding. The nest was
composed of mud and fine roots, and lined with fine grasses. The eggs, four
in number, he describes as pale blue, dashed with spots and lines of black.</p>

<p>Neither this nor the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tricolor</i> was detected by Dr. Coues in Arizona.</p>

<p>These Blackbirds were found by Mr. Ridgway abundant in the marshy
regions of California, but they were rarely met with east of the Sierra Nevada.
A few individuals were collected in Nevada in the valley of the
Truckee. A few pairs were found breeding among the <i class="birdcall">tulé</i> sloughs and
marshes. The nests found in the Truckee Reservations were built in low
bushes in wet meadows.</p>

<p>A nest procured by Dr. Cooper from the summit of the Coast Range was
built of grass and rushes, and lined with finer grass. The eggs are described
<!--187.png--><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 165]</span>
as pale greenish-white, with large curving streaks and spots of dark brown,
mostly at the large end. They are said to measure one inch by .75 of an inch.</p>

<p>Eggs of this variety in my cabinet, taken in California by Dr. Heermann,
are of a rounded-oval shape, nearly equally obtuse at either end, and varying
in length from .90 of an inch to an inch, and in breadth from .70 to .80.
Their ground-color is a light blue, fading into a bluish-white, marked only
around the larger end with waving lines of dark brown, much lighter in
shade than the markings of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phœniceus</i> usually are.</p>

Pacific Province of United States, from Columbia River southward, not yet
found out of California and Oregon.</p>

<p>Immature males sometimes have the white on the wing tinged with
brownish-yellow, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. phœniceus</i>. The red, however, has the usual
brownish-orange shade so much darker and duller than the brilliantly scarlet
shoulders of the other species, and the black has that soft bluish lustre
peculiar to the species. The relationships generally between the two species
are very close, but the bill, as stated, is slenderer and more sulcate in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tricolor</i>,
the tail much more nearly even; the first primary longer, usually nearly
equal to or longer than the fourth, instead of the fifth.</p>

<p>Two strong features of coloration distinguish the female and immature
stages of this species from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gubernator</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phœniceus</i>. They are, first, the soft
bluish gloss of the males, both adult and immature; and secondly, the clear
white and broad, not brown and narrow, borders to the middle wing-coverts.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Red and White shouldered Blackbird was seen by Mr.
Ridgway among the <i class="birdcall">tulé</i> in the neighborhood of Sacramento City, where it
was very abundant, associating with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. phœniceus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gubernator</i>, and
the Yellow-headed Blackbird. The conspicuous white stripe on the wings
<!--188.png--><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 166]</span>
of this bird renders it easily recognizable from the other species, where they
are all seen together. Mr. Ridgway is of the opinion that the notes of the
white-shouldered species differ very considerably from those of the two other
Blackbirds.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann found this a very abundant bird in California. He states
that during the winter of 1852, when hunting in the marshes of Suisan
Valley, he had often, on hearing a dull, rushing, roaring noise, found that it
was produced by a single flock of this species, numbering so many thousands
as to darken the sky for some distance by their masses. In the northern
part of California he met with a breeding-place of this species that occupied
several acres, covered with alder-bushes and willow, and was in the immediate
vicinity of water. The nests, often four or five in the same bush, were
composed of mud and straw, and lined with fine grasses. The eggs he describes
as dark blue, marked with lines and spots of dark umber and a few
light purple dashes. Dr. Heermann, at different times, fell in with several
other breeding-places of this species, similarly situated, but they had all
been abandoned, from which he inferred that each year different grounds
are resorted to by these birds for the purposes of incubation.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly obtained a specimen of this bird on the Colorado River, in
California, December, 1854. Dr. Cooper is of the opinion that it is, nevertheless,
a rare species in that valley. The latter found them the most abundant
species near San Diego and Los Angeles, and not rare at Santa Barbara.
North of the last place they pass more into the interior, and extend up as
far as Klamath Lake and Southern Oregon.</p>

<p>They are to be seen in considerable flocks even in the breeding-season.
Their song, Dr. Cooper states, is not so loud and is more guttural than are
those of the other species. Their habits are otherwise very similar, and they
associate, in fall and winter, in immense flocks in the interior, though often
also found separate.</p>

<p>These birds were first obtained by Mr. Nuttall near Santa Barbara, in the
month of April. They were very common there, as well as at Monterey.
He observed no difference in their habits from those of the common Redwing,
except that they occurred in much larger flocks and kept apart from
that species. They were seldom seen, except in the near suburbs of the
towns. At that time California was in the possession of Mexico, and its
inhabitants were largely occupied in the slaughter of wild cattle for the sake
of the hides. Mr. Nuttall found these birds feeding almost exclusively on
the maggots of the flesh-flies generated in the offal thus created. They were
in large whirling flocks, and associated with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molothri</i>, the Grakles, the
Redwings, and the Yellow-headed Blackbirds. They kept up an incessant
chatter and a discordant, confused warble, much more harsh and guttural
than even the notes of the Cow Blackbird.</p>

<p>Two eggs of this species, obtained by Dr. Heermann in California, and
now in my cabinet, measuring an inch in length by .67 of an inch in breadth,
<!--189.png--><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 167]</span>
are more oblong in shape than the preceding, but nearly equally obtuse at
either end. They are similar in ground-color to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phœniceus</i>, but are of a
slightly deeper shade of blue, and are marked around one end with a ring
of dark slaty-brown, almost black, lines, and irregular oblong blotches.</p>

Western America from Texas, Illinois,
Wisconsin, and North Red River, to California,
south into Mexico; Greenland (<span class="sc">Reinhardt</span>);
Cuba (<span class="sc">Cabanis</span>, <abbr title="Journal Seven">J. VII</abbr>, 1859, 350); Massachusetts
(<span class="sc">Maynard</span>, D. C. <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr> 1870, 122);
Volusia, Florida (<abbr title="Museum Smithsonian Institution">Mus. S. I.</abbr>); Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas.</p>

<p>The color of the yellow in this species
varies considerably; sometimes being
almost of a lemon-yellow, sometimes of
a rich orange. There is an occasional trace of yellow around the base of the
tarsus. Immature males show every gradation between the colors of the
adult male and female.</p>

<p>A very young bird (4,332, Dane <abbr title="County, Wisconsin">Co., Wis.</abbr>) is dusky above, with feathers
of the dorsal region broadly tipped with ochraceous, lesser and middle wing-coverts
white tinged with fulvous, dusky below the surface, greater coverts
very broadly tipped with fulvous-white; primary coverts narrowly tipped
with the same. Whole lower parts unvariegated fulvous-white; head all
round plain ochraceous, deepest above.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Yellow-headed Blackbird is essentially a prairie bird, and is
found in all favorable localities from Texas on the south to Illinois and
Wisconsin, and thence to the Pacific. A single specimen is recorded as having
been taken in Greenland. This was September 2, 1820, at Nenortalik.
Recently the Smithsonian Museum has received a specimen from New
Smyrna, in Florida. In October, 1869, a specimen of this bird was taken
in Watertown, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, and Mr. Cassin mentions the capture of several
near Philadelphia. These erratic appearances in places so remote from their
centres of reproduction, and from their route in emigration, sufficiently attest
the nomadic character of this species.</p>

<p>They are found in abundance in all the grassy meadows or rushy marshes of
Illinois and Wisconsin, where they breed in large communities. In swamps
overgrown with tall rushes, and partially overflowed, they construct their
nests just above the water, and build them around the stems of these water-plants,
where they are thickest, in such a manner that it is difficult to
<!--191.png--><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 169]</span>
discover them, except by diligent search, aided by familiarity with their
habits.</p>

<p>In Texas Mr. Dresser met with a few in the fall, and again in April he
found the prairies covered with these birds. For about a week vast flocks
remained about the town, after which they suddenly disappeared, and no
more were seen.</p>

<p>In California, Dr. Cooper states that they winter in large numbers in the
middle districts, some wandering to the Colorado Valley and to San Diego.
They nest around Santa Barbara, and thence northward, and are very abundant
about Klamath Lake. They associate with the other Blackbirds, but
always keep in separate companies. They are very gregarious, even in
summer.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper states that the only song the male attempts consists of a few
hoarse, chuckling notes and comical squeakings, uttered as if it was a great
effort to make any sound at all.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues speaks of it as less numerous in Arizona than at most other
localities where found at all. He speaks of it as a summer resident, but in
this I think he may have been mistaken.</p>

<p>In Western Iowa Mr. Allen saw a few, during the first week in July,
about the grassy ponds near Boonesboro’. He was told that they breed in
great numbers, north and east of that section, in the meadows of the Skunk
River country. He also reports them as breeding in large numbers in the
Calumet marshes of Northern Illinois.</p>

<p>Sir John Richardson found these birds very numerous in the interior of
the fur countries, ranging in summer as far to the north as the 58th parallel,
but not found to the eastward of Lake Winnipeg. They reached the Saskatchewan
by the 20th of May, in greater numbers than the Redwings.</p>

<p>Through California, as well as in the interior, Mr. Ridgway found the
Yellow-headed Blackbird a very abundant species, even exceeding in numbers
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. phœniceus</i>, occurring in the marshes filled with rushes. This
species he found more gregarious than the Redwing, and frequently their
nests almost filled the rushes of their breeding-places. Its notes he describes
as harsher than those of any other bird he is acquainted with. Yet they
are by no means disagreeable, while frequently their attempts at a song
were really amusing. Their usual note is a deep <i class="birdcall">cluck</i>, similar to that of
most Blackbirds, but of a rather deeper tone. In its movements upon the
ground its gait is firm and graceful, and it may frequently be seen walking
about over the grassy flats, in small companies, in a manner similar to the
Cow Blackbird, which, in its movements, it greatly resembles. It nests in
the sloughs, among the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tulé</i>, and the maximum number of its eggs is four.</p>

<p>Mr. W. J. McLaughlin of Centralia, Kansas, writes (American Naturalist,
<abbr title="Three, page">III, p.</abbr> 493) that these birds arrive in that region about the first of May, and
all disappear about the 10th of June. He does not think that any breed
there. During their stay they make themselves very valuable to the farmers
<!--192.png--><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 170]</span>
by destroying the swarms of young grasshoppers. On the writer’s land the
grasshoppers had deposited their eggs by the million. As they began to
hatch, the Yellow-heads found them out, and a flock of about two hundred
attended about two acres each day, roving over the entire lot as wild
pigeons feed, the rear ones flying to the front as the insects were devoured.</p>

<p>Mr. Clark met with these birds at New Leon, Mexico. They were always
in flocks, mingled with two or three of its congeneric species. They were
found more abundant near the coast than in the interior. There was a roost
of these birds on an island in a lagoon near Fort Brown. Between sunset
and dark these birds could be seen coming from all quarters. For about an
hour they kept up a constant chattering and changing of place. Another
similar roost was on an island near the mouth of the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly found them very common near Janos and also near Santa
Cruz, in Sonora. At the former place they were seen in the month of April
in large flocks. He describes them as quite domestic in their habits, preferring
the immediate vicinity of the houses, often feeding with the domestic
fowls in the yards.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann states that these birds collect in flocks of many thousands
with the species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agelaius</i>, and on the approach of spring separate into
smaller bands, resorting in May to large marshy districts in the valleys,
where they incubate. Their nests he found attached to the upright stalks
of the reeds, and woven around them, of flexible grasses, differing essentially
from the nests of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agelaii</i> in the lightness of their material. The
eggs, always four in number, he describes as having a ground of pale ashy-green,
thickly covered with minute dots of a light umber-brown.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall states that on the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> of May, during his western tour, he saw
these birds in great abundance, associated with the Cowbird. They kept
wholly on the ground, in companies, the sexes separated by themselves.
They were digging into the earth with their bills in search of insects and
larvæ. They were very active, straddling about with a quaint gait, and now
and then whistling out, with great effort, a chuckling note, sounding like
<i class="birdcall">ko-kuk kie-ait</i>. Their music was inferior even to the harsh notes of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M.
pecoris</i>.</p>

<p>Several nests of this species, procured in the marshes on the banks of
Lake Koskonong, in Southern Wisconsin, were sent me by Mr. Kumlien;
they were all light, neat, and elegant structures, six inches in diameter and
four in height. The cavity had a diameter of three and a depth of two and
a half inches. The base, periphery, and the greater portion of these nests
were made of interwoven grasses and sedges. The grasses were entire, with
their panicles on. They were impacted together in masses. The inner portions
of these nests were made of finer materials of the same. They were
placed in the midst of large, overflowed marshes, and were attached to tall
flags, usually in the midst of clumps of the latter, and these were so close
in their growth that the nests were not easily discovered. They contained,
<!--193.png--><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 171]</span>
usually, from five to six eggs. These are of an oblong-oval shape, and
measure 1.02 inches in length by .70 of an inch in breadth. Their ground-color
is of a pale greenish-white, profusely covered with blotches and finer
dottings of drab, purplish-brown, and umber.</p>

<p>In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magna</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neglecta</i>, the feathers of the pectoral crescent are generally
black to the base, their roots being grayish-white; one specimen of the
former, however, from North Carolina, has the roots of the feathers yellow,
forbidding the announcement of this as a distinguishing character; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mexicana</i>
may have the bases of these feathers either yellow or grayish; while <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hippocrepis</i>
has only the tips of the feathers black, the whole concealed portion
being bright yellow.</p>

<p>In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mexicana</i>, there is more of an approach to an orange tint in the yellow
than is usually seen in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magna</i>, but specimens from Georgia have a tint not
distinguishable; in both, however, as well as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hippocrepis</i>, there is a deeper
yellow than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neglecta</i>, in which the tint is more citreous.</p>

<p>As regards the bars on tertials and tail, there is considerable variation.
Sometimes in either of the species opposed to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neglecta</i> by this character
there is a tendency to their isolation, seen in the last few toward the ends
of the feathers; but never is there an approach to that regularity seen in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neglecta</i>, in which they are isolated uniformly everywhere they occur. Two
specimens only (54,064 California and 10,316 Pembina) in the entire series
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neglecta</i> show a tendency to a blending of these bars on the tail.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magna</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mexicana</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">meridionalis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hippocrepis</i>, are most similar in coloration;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neglecta</i> is most dissimilar compared with any of the others. Though
each possesses peculiar characters, they are only of degree; for in the most
widely different forms (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neglecta</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mexicana</i>) there is not the slightest
departure from the pattern of coloration; it is only a matter of extension or
restriction of the several colors, or a certain one of them, that produces the
differences.</p>

<p>Each modification of plumage is attended by a still greater one of proportions,
as will be seen from the diagnoses; thus, though <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neglecta</i> is the
largest of the group, it has actually the smallest legs and feet; with nearly
the same general proportions, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magna</i> exceeds it in the latter respects
(especially in the bill), while <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mexicana</i>, a very much smaller bird than
either, has disproportionally and absolutely larger legs and feet united with
the smallest size otherwise in the whole series. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Meridionalis</i> presents no
differences from the last, except in proportions of bill and feet; for while
the latter is the smallest of the series, next to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neglecta</i>, it has a bill much
exceeding that of any other.</p>

<p>The markings of the upper plumage of the young or even winter birds
are different in pattern from those of the adult; the tendency being toward
the peculiar features of the adult <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neglecta</i>; the various species in these
stages being readily distinguishable, however, by the general characters
assigned. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mexicana</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neglecta</i> are both in proportions and colors the
<!--196.png--><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 174]</span>
most widely different in the whole series; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hippocrepis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neglecta</i> the
most similar. The relation of the several races to each other is about as

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The eastern form of the Meadow Lark is found in all the eastern
portions of the United States, from Florida to Texas at the south, and from
Nova Scotia to the Missouri at the north. Richardson met with it on the
<!--197.png--><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 175]</span>
Saskatchewan, where it arrives about the first of May. In a large portion
of the United States it is resident, or only partially migratory.</p>

<p>In Maine this species is not abundant. A few are found in Southern
Maine, even as far to the east as Calais, where it is very rare. It was not
found in Oxford County by Mr. Verrill. In New Hampshire and Vermont,
especially in the southern portions, it is much more abundant. Throughout
Massachusetts it is a common summer visitant, a few remaining all winter,
the greater number coming in March and leaving again in November, at
which time they seem to be somewhat, though only partially, gregarious.
South of Massachusetts it becomes more generally resident, and is only very
partially migratory, where the depth of snow compels them to seek food
elsewhere. Wilson states that he met a few of these birds in the month
of February, during a deep snow, among the heights of the Alleghanies,
near Somerset, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr></p>

<p>The favorite resorts of this species are old fields, pasture-lands, and meadows,
localities in which they can best procure the insects, largely coleopterous,
and the seeds on which they feed. They are not found in woods or
thickets, or only in very exceptional cases.</p>

<p>In New England they are shy, retiring birds, and are rarely seen in the
neighborhood of houses; but in Georgia and South Carolina, Wilson found
them swarming among the rice plantations, and running about in the yards
and the out-buildings, in company with the Killdeer Plovers, with little
or no appearance of fear, and as if domesticated.</p>

<p>In Alabama and West Florida, Mr. Nuttall states, the birds abound during
the winter months, and may be seen in considerable numbers in the salt
marshes, seeking their food and the shelter of the sea-coast. They are then
in loose flocks of from ten to thirty. At this season many are shot and
brought to market. By some their flesh is said to be sweet and good; but
this is denied by Audubon, who states it to be tough and of unpleasant flavor.</p>

<p>Mr. Sclater records the occurrence of one or more individuals of this
species in England.</p>

<p>The song of the eastern Meadow Lark is chiefly distinguished for its
sweetness more than any other excellence. When, in spring, at the height
of their love-season, they alight on the post of a fence, a bush, or tree, or
any other high object, they will give utterance to notes that, in sweetness
and tenderness of expression, are surpassed by very few of our birds. But
they are wanting in variety and power, and are frequently varied, but not
improved, by the substitution of chattering call-notes, which are much inferior
in quality. It is noticeable that at the West there is a very great improvement
in the song of this bird as compared with that of their more
eastern kindred, though still very far from equalling, either in volume,
variety, or power, the remarkable song of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neglecta</i>.</p>

<p>In the fall of the year these birds collect in small companies, and feed
together in the same localities, but keeping, individually, somewhat apart.</p>

<p><!--198.png--><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 176]</span>
In New England these birds mate during the latter part of April, and
construct their nests in May. They always place their nest on the ground,
usually in the shelter of a thick tuft of grass, and build a covered passage
to their hidden nest. This entrance is usually formed of withered grass,
and so well conceals the nest that it can only be detected by flushing the
female from it, or by the anxiety of her mate, who will frequently fly round
the spot in so narrow a circuit as to betray its location.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Meadow Lark vary greatly in size and also in their markings,
though the general character of the latter is the same. The smallest,
from Florida, measure .95 by .68 of an inch. The largest, from Massachusetts,
measure 1.20 inches by .90. They have a white ground, marked and
dotted with irregular reddish-brown spots. Generally these are equally
distributed, but occasionally are chiefly about the larger end. Their shape
is oval, nearly equally rounded at either end.</p>

<p>The diversity in the characteristics of the eggs of this species has not unfrequently
occasioned remarks, and even suggested conjectures as to specific
differences. They are all, however, reconcilable with differences in the age
of the parents, and are, to some extent, affected by the circumstances under
which they are deposited. The eggs of old, mature birds, deposited in the
early summer, or the first brood, are usually sub-globular or obtusely pointed
at either end, large in size, and irregularly sprinkled over with fine bright
red dots. Younger birds, breeding for the first time, birds that have been
robbed of their eggs, or those depositing a third set, have smaller eggs, sometimes
two thirds of the maximum size, more oblong and more pointed at one
end, and are marked, at the larger end only, with plashes of dark purplish-brown.</p>

<span class="sc">Habits.</span> The differences of plumage between this species and our eastern
Meadow Lark are so slight that we might hesitate to allow the existence of
any specific distinctness between the two forms, were it not for the very
strongly marked differences between them in other respects. Whether we
regard them as races or as different species, their history diverges as we cross
the Missouri River, though both are found on either bank.</p>

<p>The existence of this variety was first made known by Messrs. Lewis and
Clark, in their memorable expedition to the Rocky Mountains. They refer
especially to the difference, in the notes, between this bird and the old Field
Lark of the east. It remained unnoticed by our ornithologists until 1844,
when Mr. Audubon included it in the appendix to his seventh volume. He
met with it in his voyage to the Yellowstone, and it would have escaped his
notice had not the attention of his party been called to its curious notes.
In its flight, manners on the ground, or general habits, he could perceive no
difference between it and the common species. None of its nests that he
found were covered over, in the manner of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magna</i>, and the eggs were
differently marked.</p>

<p>Mr. J. A. Allen, in his interesting paper on the birds observed in Western
Iowa, while he does not admit any specific difference between these two
forms, presents with impartial exactness the very striking dissimilarity between
them, both in habits and in song. In regard to the diversity in habits
we quote his words:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“At the little village of Denison, where I first noticed it in song, it was
particularly common, and half domestic in its habits, preferring the streets
and grassy lanes, and the immediate vicinity of the village, to the remoter
prairie. Here, wholly unmolested and unsuspicious, it collected its food;
and the males, from their accustomed perches on the housetops, daily warbled
their wild songs for hours together.” These traits of familiarity, so totally
different from anything ever observed in our eastern birds, he does not concede,
however, as establishing necessarily specific difference. Yet he does admit
that its song was so new to him that he did not at first have the slightest
suspicion that its utterer was the western Meadow Lark, as he found it to be.
He adds: “It differs from that of the Meadow Lark in the Eastern States,
in the notes being louder and wilder, and at the same time more liquid, mellower,
and far sweeter. They have a pensiveness and a general character
remarkably in harmony with the half-dreamy wildness of the primitive
prairie, as though the bird had received from its surroundings their peculiar
impress. It differs, too, in the less frequency of the harsh, complaining
chatter so conspicuous in the eastern bird.”</p>

<p>The value of these marked differences, both in song and character, between
the eastern and western birds, we will not argue, but will only add that they
are none too strikingly presented by Mr. Allen. During the writer’s brief
visit to the Plains he was strongly impressed by the natural, confiding
trustfulness of this species and its wonderful beauty of song, both in
<!--202.png--><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 178]</span>
such remarkable contrast with the habits of our eastern birds. At Antelope
Station a pair of these birds had built their nest under the window of the
office, and seemed to enjoy the society of the family, while the depot-master,
familiar with the song and habits of our eastern birds, appreciated the great
differences between the two forms, and called my attention to them.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen also found this Lark everywhere abundant in Colorado, but its
notes appeared to him quite different from those of the representatives of
this species living to the eastward, in the prairie States, being less varied
and ringing, and more guttural.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper says this bird is abundant in California, and resident nearly
throughout the entire State, breeding in the Colorado Valley and in all other
districts not quite waterless. Their songs are lively, sweet, and varied.
They sing at all seasons, early and late, from the ground, from the tree-top,
or in the air, and when unmolested are so tame as to make the house-top
their favorite perch. Even the female has considerable musical power, and
cheers her mate by singing to him while he relieves her by sitting on the
eggs. She also has a harsh, petulant chirp, frequently repeated as if in
anger. He states that they build their nest in a slight depression under a
bunch of grass, and usually more or less arched over and artfully concealed.
The female, when flushed, usually skulks off some distance before she flies.
The eggs he describes as white, with a few large purplish-brown blotches and
dots towards the larger end, and measuring 1.15 inches by .85. They are
very obtuse in shape.</p>

<p>They feed chiefly on insects, seeds, and grain, do no damage to the crops,
and destroy a vast number of noxious insects.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley found this bird common everywhere in Oregon and Washington
Territory, some remaining throughout every winter. In 1855 a few
were seen at Fort Dalles as early as March 5. On the 7th he found them
quite abundant on the ploughed fields near Fort Vancouver. Some of these
had probably remained all the winter. In February, 1856, he found them
quite abundant at Fort Steilacoom. At Fort Dalles, by the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> of May, he
obtained young birds nearly fledged.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser found it very common during winter near San Antonio, where
a few remain to breed.</p>

<p>In Arizona, according to Dr. Coues, it is resident, but quite rare.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Couch found these birds from the Rio Grande to the high
bottoms of the Lower Bolson de Mapimi. Its notes he speaks of as highly
musical, contending even with the Mocking Bird for a supremacy in song.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway found the western Meadow Lark one of the most abundant
and characteristic birds of California and all fertile portions of the interior
as far east as the Missouri, and remarks that, although closely resembling the
eastern bird in appearance, its song is totally different, not a note uttered
by it having more than a very distant resemblance to any of the well-known
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magna</i> of the eastern meadows. In the depth of its tone and the charms
<!--203.png--><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 179]</span>
of its articulation its song is hardly excelled, resembling very nearly the
song of the Wood Thrush. Mr. Ridgway describes its modulations as expressed
by the syllables <i class="birdcall">tung-tung-tungah-til’lah-til’lah-tung</i>, each note powerful
and distinct. The difference between the other notes of the two birds
is still greater than in their song, and even in character these are not alike.
In the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">neglecta</i> the call-note of watchfulness or alarm is a loud, deep-toned
<i class="birdcall">tuck</i>, similar to the <i class="birdcall">chuck</i> of the Blackbird, but much louder and more metallic.
That of sympathy for the young, or anxiety when the nest is approached, is
a loud, liquid <i class="birdcall">tyur</i>, slightly resembling the complaining note of the eastern
Bluebird, and also of the Orchard Oriole. All of its notes are of a power
corresponding to the size of the bird.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway also notices important differences in their flight. That of
the eastern species is carried on by an occasional spasmodic beat or jerk of
the wings, which are then extended, the bird sailing a short distance. The
flight of the western Lark is much more irregular, the bird flitting along by
a trembling flutter of the wings, never assuming these peculiar features.</p>

<p>An egg of this species, collected by Dr. Cooper in Washington Territory,
June 19, 1856, measures 1.20 inches in length and .86 in breadth. It is of
an oblong-oval shape, obtuse; the ground white, sparingly spotted with a
very dark purple, most of the markings being at the larger end. Three eggs
from Arizona, collected by Dr. Palmer, measure 1.10 inches by .80. The
markings are of much lighter shades of lilac, purple, and purplish and reddish-brown.
The markings are more generally diffused, but predominate at
the larger end. An egg from the Yellowstone, collected by Mr. Audubon, is
unusually pointed at one end, measures 1.13 inches by .82. The spots
are a dark purplish-brown, intermingled with smaller and lighter dottings
of reddish-brown. Eggs from California do not vary essentially in their
markings from those of Arizona, and have an average measurement of 1.10
inches by .85. As a general rule, the mottling of the eggs of the western
bird is finer than that of the eastern.</p>

In the other genera the culmen advances somewhat on the forehead, but
it is in a narrow acute point, and not dilated.</p>

<p>In studying the North American
Orioles we have found it
exceedingly difficult to arrange
them in any sharply defined
sections, as whatever characters
be taken as the basis of classification,
the other features will
not correspond. Thus, species
with the bill of the same proportions
and amount of curvature
differ in the shape and
graduation of the tail, while tails of the same form are accompanied by
entirely dissimilar bills and wings. The bill is sometimes much attenuated
and decurved, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">I. cucullatus</i>,
while in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melanocephalus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">baltimore</i>
it is stouter and straighter.
The tail is usually much graduated;
in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">I. baltimore</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bullocki</i> it is
only moderately rounded. These
last-mentioned species constitute
the genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hyphantes</i>. Many of the
species have a naked space round
the eye, very evident in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">I. vulgaris</i>,
less so in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melanocephalus. I. vulgaris</i> is peculiar in having the feathers of
the throat pointed and lanceolate, as in the ravens.</p>

<p>In view of the difficulties attendant upon the definition of subordinate
groups among the United States <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Icterinæ</i>, we propose to consider them all
under the single genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Icterus</i>, leaving it for some one with more ingenuity
to establish satisfactory divisions into sub-genera.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_34" id="fnanchor_34"></a><a href="#footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></span></p>

<p><!--205.png--><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 181]</span>
The colors of the Orioles are chiefly black and yellow, or orange, the wing
sometimes marked with white. The females are generally much duller in
plumage, and the young male usually remains in immature dress till the
third year. In all the North American species the rump is of the same
color with the belly; the chin, throat, and tail, black.</p>

<p>In the North American Orioles the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">baltimore</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bullocki</i> have the tail
but little graduated; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spurius</i>, more so; the others very decidedly graduated.
The bills of the two first mentioned are stout and nearly straight; that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">I.
melanocephalus</i> quite similar. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">I. parisorum</i> has the bill more attenuated,
but scarcely more decurved; in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spurius</i> it is attenuated and decurved, much
as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">wagleri</i>; this character is strongest in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">I. cucullatus</i>. The much graduated
tail is combined with a slender decurved bill in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">I. cucullatus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">wagleri</i>;
with a straighter one in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parisorum</i>; with a thick, nearly straight, one in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melanocephalus</i>.
The arrangement, according to the graduation of the tail,
would be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">baltimore</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bullocki, spurius, parisorum, wagleri, melanocephalus</i>, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cucullatus</i>. According to stoutness and curvature of bill, it would be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">baltimore,
melanocephalus, bullocki</i>,<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">parisorum, spurius wagleri</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cucullatus</i>.</p>

<p>All the species have the rump and under parts yellow or orange. All
have the head entirely black, except <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bullocki</i>, in which its sides are orange,
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cucullatus</i>, which has an orange crown. All have black on the throat.
In the species with black head and neck, all have the tails black towards the
end, except <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bullocki</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">baltimore</i>.</p>

<p>The females and young males are so entirely different in colors from the
adult males, and so similar in the different species, that they can best be
distinguished by the details of form and size. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">I. prosthemelas</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">I.
melanocephalus</i> are placed, according to the above arrangement, in different
subgenera, yet the young male of the former and the adult male of the latter
are so perfectly similar in colors as to be undistinguishable in this respect,
and require careful examination of points of external structure to be separated
(see description of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">I. melanocephalus</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 782).</p>

Northern South America and West Indies? Accidental on the southern coast
of the United States?</p>

<p>This is the largest Oriole said to be found in the United States, and differs
from the rest in its longer bill, and pointed, elongated feathers on the throat.
The bill is attenuated, and somewhat decurved. The third quill is longest,
the first quill almost the shortest of all the primaries. The outer tail-feather
is about .60 of an inch less than the middle.</p>

<p>There is only a trace of whitish on the edges of the primaries. The
broad white edges to the secondaries are continuous in the folded wing with
the white on the greater coverts, the lowest row of which, however, is black.
The extreme and concealed base of the tail is white.</p>

<p>One specimen has the light markings yellow, instead of orange.</p>

<p>This species is given by Mr. Audubon as North American, on the strength
of occasional stragglers from South America. One of the specimens before
us was received from Mr. Audubon (2,842), and is, possibly, North American,
<!--209.png--><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 185]</span>
although we doubt very much whether the species was ever taken within
our limits, except as escaped from captivity.</p>

<p>An allied race (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">I. longirostris</i>) from New Grenada has a longer and more
slender bill, and a paler, lemon-yellow color. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">I. aurantius</i> of Brazil
lacks the long, pointed, distinct feathers of the throat, and is of an intensely
rich orange-red color, with much the same pattern as the present bird.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Troupial of South America and some of the West
India Islands is probably only an imported species, or an accidental visitant.
It is given by Mr. Audubon in the appendix to his seventh volume, on the
strength of a specimen shot in Charleston, <abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr>, by his son, John W. The
bird, when first seen, was perched on the point of the lightning-rod of Dr.
Bachman’s house. A few days after others were seen, one of which was
shot, though it fell into the river and was lost. Mr. Audubon was afterwards
informed that small groups of four or five subsequently made their
appearance in the same city and among the islands. If his information was
correct, it precludes the supposition that those which have been procured
are caged birds. Yet the Troupial is so common and so popular a bird in
the cage, that its accidental occurrence is possible in many localities it never
visits of its own accord.</p>

<p>This bird is common in all the northern countries of South America,
Venezuela, Guiana, Rio Negro, Northern Brazil, etc. Its occurrence in Jamaica
and the West Indies may be only accidental. It is said by Daudin
to be a common species in South America, where it associates in large flocks,
and constructs a large and pensile nest. In confinement it becomes very
easily tamed, is reconciled to a life of imprisonment, and is very fond
of those who feed and care for it. It has a loud, clear, and ringing
whistle, and a great variety of call-notes and single or brief utterances, but
rarely indulges in a continuous song. One kept in confinement several years
answered readily to the name of <i class="name">Troopy</i>, and always promptly responded,
when thus addressed by his mistress, in notes of unmistakable and affectionate
recognition. He was very fond of his liberty, and used his sharp
bill with such effect that it was difficult to keep him in his cage. When at
large he never attempted to escape, but returned upon being called. He,
however, acquired such a mortal antipathy to children, attacked them so
fiercely when at large, and his sharp bill was so dangerous a weapon, that it
was found very necessary to keep him a close prisoner.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species measure 1.02 inches in length by .88 of an inch
in breadth; they are a rounded, obtuse oval in shape. Their ground-color
is a reddish-drab, and they are very generally blotched with markings of a
deep claret-brown and faint purple, the markings being deeper and larger at
one end.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This handsome and rather recent addition to our fauna is a
Northern Mexican species, which extends north to the valley of the Rio
Grande and into Texas, from various localities in which it has been procured.
Lt. D. N. Couch, who found this species common from the Lower Rio Grande
to the Sierra Madre, speaks of the strong mutual attachment shown by the
sexes. He describes its song as soft and melancholy, and the notes as resembling
<i class="birdcall">peut-pou-it</i>. The sweetness of its notes renders it a favorite as a
caged bird. In the State of Vera Cruz this bird is given by Sumichrast as
inhabiting the temperate regions, and as there having exclusively their centre
of propagation. They are very common in the district of Orizaba, where they
<!--211.png--><!--Plate 35-->
<!--212.png--><!--blank page-->
<!--213.png--><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 187]</span>
breed. Their common name is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calandria</i>, a name also given, without discrimination,
to four or five other species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Icteri</i> common in Vera Cruz.
Mr. Pease, in 1847, observed either this species or the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melanocephalus</i> at
Jalapa, and in the neighborhood of the city of Mexico, in considerable numbers.
This bird was first described and brought to notice as belonging to
our fauna, by Mr. Giraud, in 1841. Since then, Mr. John H. Clark, zoölogist
on the Mexican Boundary Survey, obtained several specimens from the
Lower Rio Grande. It was first seen by him near Ringgold Barracks. It
was not abundant, and its quiet manners and secluded habits prevented it
from being very conspicuous. It was most frequently observed by him
feeding on the fruit of the hackberry, but whenever approached, while thus
feeding, it always showed signs of uneasiness, and soon after sought refuge
in some place of greater concealment.</p>

<p>Usually pairs were to be seen keeping close together, apparently preferring
the thick foliage found on the margin of ponds, or in the old bed of the
river. They did not communicate with each other by any note, and Mr.
Clark was struck with their remarkable silence. Their habits seemed to
him very different from those of any other Oriole with which he was acquainted.</p>

<p>From the papers of Lieutenant Couch, quoted by Mr. Cassin, we learn
that these birds were seen by him, March 3, at Santa Rosalio, eight leagues
from Matamoras. They were in pairs, and both sexes were very shy and
secluded, seeking insects on the prickly pear, or among the low mimosa-trees,
seeming to be never at rest, but ever on the lookout for their favorite
food.</p>

<p>While at Charco Escondido, farther in the interior of Tamaulipas, Lieutenant
Couch met with a pair of these birds, and having brought down the
male bird with his gun, the female flew to a neighboring tree, apparently
unaware of her loss. She soon, however, observed his fall, and endeavored
to recall him to her side with notes uttered in a strain of such exquisite
sadness that he could scarcely believe them uttered by a bird; and so
greatly did they excite his sympathy, that he almost resolved to desist from
further ornithological collections. He adds that he never heard the lay of
any songster of the feathered tribe expressed more sweetly than that of the
present species. At Monterey he found it a favorite cage-bird. The female
also sings, but her notes are less powerful than those of the male. Generally
the flight of this bird was low and rapid, and it seemed to prefer the shade
of trees. It was observed almost invariably in pairs, and the male and
female showed for each other great tenderness and solicitude.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species measure .90 of an inch in length by .70 in
breadth. Their ground-color is a light drab or a dull purplish-white, scattered
over which are faint markings of a subdued purple, blending imperceptibly
with the ground, and above these markings are dots and irregular
zigzag lines of dark brown, and darker purple, almost running into black.</p>

The tail is moderately graduated, the outer feather .45 of an inch less than

<p>In this species the black feathers of the neck, except below, have a subterminal
bar of yellow; elsewhere it is wanting. The black of the breast
comes a little posterior to the anterior extremity of the folded wing. The
posterior feathers in the yellow patch on the shoulders are tinged with white.
The white in the bar across the ends of the greater coverts is confined
mainly to the terminal quarter of an inch of the outer web. In the full
plumage, there is only a faint trace of white on the edges of the primaries.
The yellow of the base of the tail only extends on the middle feather as far
as the end of the upper tail-coverts; on the three outer, it reaches to within
an inch and a quarter of the end of the tail.</p>

<p>An immature male has the yellow more tinged with green, the black feathers

<p><!--215.png--><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 189]</span>
<span class="sc">Habits.</span> Notwithstanding the apparent abundance of the species at Cape
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, and also in Northern Mexico along our entire border, as far as
New Mexico and Texas, our knowledge of its history still remains quite incomplete.
A single specimen was obtained in Western Texas on the Pecos
River, by Captain Pope, in 1856. Others were obtained by Lieutenant
Couch, April, 1853, at Santa Catarina, in Mexico. They were first seen by
him in the vicinity of Monterey. They were found to be generally of secluded
habits. Their song, consisting of three or four notes, is said to be
both rich and melodious.</p>

<p>In the State of Vera Cruz, this species is given by Sumichrast as occurring
in both the temperate and the alpine regions. Its common name is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calandria
india</i>. They are said by him to occur chiefly in the temperate parts,
where they breed, but not to be exclusively confined there, for they are also
found in the alpine region to the height of at least five thousand feet, near
Orizaba, and on the plateau at even a higher elevation. Dr. Cooper saw a
bird at Fort Mohave, in April, which he supposed to be this bird, but he was
not able to assure himself of the fact, by obtaining it.</p>

<p>Mr. Xantus found this species very abundant during his stay at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Lucas, and procured a number of specimens of the birds and of their nests
and eggs. From his brief notes we gather that the nests are open, and are
not pensile. One, found May 22, was built in a bunch of moss hanging
<!--216.png--><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 190]</span>
down from an old cactus. Another was made in a bunch of hops, suspended
from a cactus. A third was placed in a bunch of weeds growing
out from a crevice in a perpendicular rock. Another, found May 29, was
built in a small dead tree, overhung with vines. This nest was about five
feet from the ground. A nest containing four young birds was found placed
in a bunch of moss, hanging out of a crevice in a rock. These instances
serve to show the general character of the position of their nests. Without
being pensile they are usually resting upon pendent branches, and are not
placed at great elevations.</p>

<p>The eggs measure .90 of an inch in length by .65 in breadth. Their shape
is an oblong-oval, and they are obtuse at either end. Their ground-color is
a dull white, with a purplish or a bluish tint. They are variously marked,
in different eggs, with small blotches and finer dottings of a light purple,
purplish-brown, darker purple, and even black.</p>

<p>This species varies greatly in size with its geographical distribution.</p>

Winter specimens from Mexico have the black obscured by brownish
borders to the feathers.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Orchard Oriole is found abundant throughout most of the
United States, from the Atlantic to the Missouri Valley, and on the southwest
to the valley of the Rio Grande. Mr. J. A. Allen met with individuals
of this species as far west as the base of the Rocky Mountains, in Colorado,
which he regards as the extreme western limit. It is a very rare summer
visitant in New England, though found even as far eastward as Calais, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr>
It was not found in Western Maine by Verrill, nor am I aware of its having
been met with in either New Hampshire or Vermont. Mr. Allen states that
a few pairs breed every season near Springfield, in Western Massachusetts.
I have never met with it in the eastern part of the State, but others have
been more fortunate, and it is probable that a few visit us each season.</p>

<p>In Texas Mr. Dresser found this species very common at San Antonio
during the summer, arriving there quite early in April. He procured a number
of their nests, all of which were made of light-colored flexible grasses,
and suspended from the upper branches of the mesquite-trees. He also
found them breeding near Houston, and on Galveston Island. He describes
them as much smaller than birds from the Northern States. This smaller
race Mr. Lawrence has regarded as a distinct species, to which he gives the
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">affinis</i>. It has been traced as far to the west as Fort Riley in Kansas,
and Fort Lookout in Nebraska. It winters in Guatemala, where it is
very abundant at that season. Mr. James McLeannan killed it as far south
as Panama.</p>

<p>Dr. Elliott Coues considers this bird as rare and chiefly migrant in South
Carolina; but Mr. H. S. Rodney (Naturalist, <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr>, 1872) found them quite
numerous at Camden, in that State, in the summer of 1871. He met with
five nests between June 28 and July 19, and has no doubt he could have
taken many more, as he counted at least fifteen different pairs. From the
fact that Dr. Coues did not meet with any nest at Columbia, only thirty miles
distant, Mr. Rodney infers that this Oriole is very partial to certain favored
localities, as is also the Baltimore.</p>

<p>The Orchard Oriole is an active, sprightly, and very lively species, and
possesses a very peculiar and somewhat remarkable song. Its notes are
very rapidly enunciated, and are both hurried and energetic. Some writers
speak of the song as confused, but this attribute is not in the utterance of
the song, the musician manifesting anything but confusion in the rapid and
distinct enunciation of his gushing notes. These may be too quick in their
utterance for the listener to follow, but they are wonderful both for their
rapidity and their harmony. His performance consists of shrill and lively
notes, uttered with an apparent air of great agitation, and they are quite as
distinct and agreeable, though neither so full nor so rich, as are those of the
more celebrated Golden Robin.</p>

<p>In the Central States, from New York to North Carolina, these birds are
<!--218.png--><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 192]</span>
not only very abundant, but very generally diffused. Hardly an orchard
or a garden of any size can be found without them. They seem to prefer
apple-trees for their abode, and for the construction of their nests. These
structures, though essentially different, are, in their style of architecture,
quite as curiously wrought and ingenious as those of the Baltimore. They
are suspended from small twigs, often at the very extremity of the branches.
In Pennsylvania they are usually formed externally of a peculiar kind of long,
tough, and flexible grass. This material is woven through and through in a
very wonderful manner, and with as much neatness and intricacy as if actually
sewed with a needle. They are hemispherical in shape, open at the top,
and generally about four inches in breadth and three deep. The cavity has
a depth and a width of about two inches.</p>

<p>Wilson states that, having had the curiosity to detach one of these fibres
of dried grass from the nest, he found it thirteen inches in length, and that,
in that distance, it had been hooked through and returned no less than thirty-four
times! In this manner it was passed entirely around the nest. The
nests are occasionally lined with wool or the down of seeds. The external
portions are strongly fastened to several twigs, so that they may be blown
about by the wind without being upset.</p>

<p>Wilson also remarks that he observed that when these nests are built in
the long pendent branches of the weeping-willow, where they are liable to
much greater motion, though formed of the same materials, they are always
made much deeper and of slighter texture. He regards this as a manifestation
of a remarkable intelligence, almost equivalent to reason. The
willow, owing to the greater density of its foliage, affords better shelter, and
is preferred on that account, and owing to the great sweep, in the wind, of
the branches, the eggs would be liable to be rolled out if the nest were of
the usual depth; hence this adaptation to such positions.</p>

<p>The food of the Orchard Oriole is almost exclusively insects. Of these
it consumes a large number, and with them it also feeds its young.
Most of these are of the kinds most obnoxious to the husbandman, preying
upon the foliage, destroying the fruit, and otherwise injuring the trees,
and their destroyers render an incalculable amount of benefit to the gardens
they favor with their presence. At the same time they are entirely
innocent of injury to crops of any description, and I cannot find that any
accusations or expressions of suspicion have been raised against them. They
seem to be, therefore, general favorites, and, wherever protected, evince their
appreciation of this good-will by their familiarity and numbers.</p>

<p>The female sits upon her eggs fourteen days, and the young remain in the
nest about ten days longer. They are supposed to have occasionally two
broods in a season, as nests with eggs are found the last of July. They
are said to arrive in Pennsylvania about the first of May, and to leave before
the middle of September.</p>

<p>According to Wilson they are easily raised from the nest, and become very
<!--219.png--><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 193]</span>
tame and familiar. One that he kept through the winter, when two months
old whistled with great clearness and vivacity.</p>

<p>All the nests of this species that I have seen from Georgia, Florida,
Louisiana, or Texas, have no lining, but are wholly made of one material,
a flexible kind of reed or grass.</p>

<p>The sociability of this species is one of its most marked characteristics.
Audubon says that he has known no less than nine nests in the same enclosure,
and all the birds living together in great harmony.</p>

<p>A nest of this bird, taken in Berlin, <abbr title="Connecticut">Conn.</abbr>, by Mr. Brandigee, has a diameter
and a height of four inches. Its cavity is three inches in depth, and varies
from three to three and a half in diameter, being widest at the centre, or
half-way between the top and the base. It is entirely homogeneous, having
been elaborately and skilfully woven of long green blades of grass. The
inside is lined with animal wool, bits of yarn, and intermingled with a
wooly substance of entirely vegetable origin. It was built from the extremity
of the branch of an apple-tree.</p>

<p>An egg of this species, from Washington, measures .85 of an inch in
length by .62 in breadth. The ground is a pale bluish-white, blotched with
a pale purple, and dashed, at the larger end, with a few deep markings of
dark purplish-brown. An egg from New Mexico is similar, but measures
.79 of an inch by .54. Both are oblong oval, and pointed at one end.</p>

<p>The orange varies greatly in tint and intensity with the individual;
sometimes it is deep orange-red; often clear dull yellow, but more frequently
of an oily orange.</p>

<p>This species is closely allied to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">I. aurocapillus</i> of South America, but
<!--220.png--><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 194]</span>
differs in having black, not yellow, shoulders, and in the white markings on
the wings.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Hooded Oriole is essentially a Mexican species, though it
also extends northward into Texas at the Rio Grande, and into Southern
California and Arizona. It was not noticed by Dr. Coues in Arizona, but
Lieutenant Charles Bendire found it breeding near Tucson in the summer
of 1872. It is abundant at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas. Dr. Cooper found that this
species arrived at San Diego about April 22, where they were not rare for
a fortnight afterwards, and all then retired into the warmer interior valleys,
where he has seen them as far to the north as Los Angeles. While migrating,
they were generally silent.</p>

<p>Captain McCown found it quite common on the Rio Grande, where it
rears its young. When met with in the woods and far away from the
abodes of men, it seemed shy and disposed to conceal itself. Yet a pair of
these birds were his constant visitors, morning and evening. They came
to the vicinity of his quarters&mdash;an unfinished building&mdash;at Ringgold Barracks,
and at last became so tame and familiar that they would pass from
some ebony-trees, that stood near by, to the porch, clinging to the shingles
and rafters, frequently in an inverted position, prying into the holes and
crevices, apparently in search of spiders and such insects as could be found
there. From this occupation they would occasionally desist, to watch his
movements. He never could induce them to partake of the food he offered
them.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Couch found this species common in the states of Tamaulipas
and New Leon. He found their nests generally on or under the tops of
the palm known as the Spanish bayonet.</p>

<p>This species is given by Mr. Sumichrast as one of the birds of Vera Cruz,
where it is exclusively an inhabitant of the hot region, and where it is rarely
found above an elevation of eighteen hundred feet.</p>

<p>These birds were found quite abundant at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, Lower California,
by Mr. Xantus, by whom a number of their nests and eggs were obtained.
The following brief memoranda in regard to a few of these nests will serve
to show their general position:&mdash;“Nest and two eggs, found May 20, about
ten feet from the ground, woven to a small aloe, in a bunch of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acacia
prosopis</i>. Nest and two eggs, found May 22, on a dry tree overhung with
hops. Nest and one egg, found May 30, on an acacia, about fifteen feet
from the ground. Nest with young, found on an aloe four feet high.
Nest and eggs, found on a moss hanging out of a perpendicular bluff, on
the sea-coast. Nest and eggs found on a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Yucca angustifolia</i>, on its stem,
six feet from the ground. Nest and two eggs, found in a convolvulus,
on a perpendicular rock fifty feet high. Nest and three eggs, found on an
acacia, twenty-five feet high.”</p>

<p>The eggs of this species vary somewhat in shape, some being obtuse and
more spherical, others more pointed and oblong. They vary in length from
<!--221.png--><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 195]</span>
.92 to .88 of an inch, and from .68 to .65 of an inch in breadth. They
have a clear white ground, marbled and blotched with large dashes, dots, and
irregular zigzag lines of purple, brown, and black, chiefly disposed around
the larger end. In those where the spots are more diffused they are blended
with obscure blotches of a faint lavender.</p>

<p>A young bird is soft, dull orange beneath, palest on the throat, and tinged
along the sides with olive; above olive, with an orange cast on the rump and
tail, the latter being without any black; centres of dorsal feathers blackish;
wings blackish, with two broad white bands across coverts, and broad edges
of white to the tertials.</p>

<p>Specimens collected in Western Kansas, by Mr. J. A. Allen, have the
middle wing-coverts pure white instead of deep orange, and, according to
that naturalist, have more slender bills than Eastern birds. Mr. Allen thinks
they form a race peculiar to the plains; but in examining the series of specimens
in the museum of the Smithsonian Institution, we have failed to discover
any constancy in this respect. A male (5,356, Farm <abbr title="Island">Isl.</abbr>, May 30) from
Nebraska has the middle wing-coverts pure white,&mdash;the lesser, clear orange;
the black throat-stripe is almost separated from the black of the cheeks by
the extension forward of the orange on each side of it, only the tips of the
feathers being black.</p>

<p><abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 61,192 <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr>, Mount Carmel, <abbr title="Illinois">Ill.</abbr> (August 12), has the throat-stripe even

<!--222.png--><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 196]</span>
superciliary stripe, mostly concealed, however, by the black tips of the
feathers. The middle coverts, like the lesser, are pure plain orange.</p>

<p>A male from Cape May, <abbr title="New Jersey">N. J.</abbr> (59,458, May), has the middle coverts white,
and the lesser wholly uniform black. The head, however, is as in typical
specimens.</p>

<p>In a series of twenty adult spring males from Carlisle, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>, seven have
the middle coverts more or less white. But it is noticed that all these specimens
with white middle coverts have invariably less intense colors than
those with orange shoulders, while in the Kansas specimens the other colors
are of the brightest character.</p>

<p>A male from Washington (12,317, May 6) is exactly similar.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The familiar Baltimore Oriole, the Golden Robin of the New
England States, is found throughout eastern North America, at various seasons,
from Texas to the British Possessions, and from the Atlantic to the
plains. It is, however, for the most part, not common beyond the Mississippi
River. It has been traced as far to the north as the 55th parallel
of latitude, and probably breeds more or less abundantly in every State
east of the Mississippi River. It is rare in Florida, and is not given by
Mr. Allen as known to that State, but I have received its nest and eggs
from Monticello in West Florida. The Smithsonian Museum embraces
specimens from as far west as Powder River and the Yellowstone.</p>

<p>Mr. J. A. Allen (<abbr title="American">Am.</abbr> Naturalist, June, 1872) mentions finding this species
at the base of the Rocky Mountains, in Colorado, which he regards as its
extreme western limit. In Kansas he found this species, as well as the
Orchard Oriole, abundant, the Baltimore indulging in a dialect so different
from that of its northern relatives as often to puzzle him to make out to
what bird its strange notes belonged. Its colors were also unusually bright
in all the specimens he examined.</p>

<p>Mr. Boardman gives it as very rare at Calais, but Professor Verrill thinks
it common in Western Maine. It is abundant throughout the southern
and central portions of Vermont, and New Hampshire, and in all New York.
It is a common summer resident at Hamilton, Ontario, where it arrives the
second week in May. It was found on the plains of the Saskatchewan by
Captain Blakiston.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser states it to have been abundant at Matamoras, where it was
breeding, though he was too late for its eggs. He saw none at San Antonio,
but Mr. J. H. Clark was more fortunate. Numbers of them, he states, were
seen nesting in the mesquite-trees on the prairies, at which time they
were very musical, having sometimes as many as three nests in the same
tree. These were all built of fine grass, among the top branches, and interwoven
with the leaves. Dr. Woodhouse found it quite common in the
Indian Territory and in Eastern Texas. Specimens of this species were
taken by Mr. James M. Leannan, at Panama, which is presumed to be the
most southern locality on record for this bird.</p>

<p><!--223.png--><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 197]</span>
The Baltimore Oriole is one of the most common birds nearly throughout
New England. Gay and brilliant in plumage, interesting and lively in manners
and habits, and a vocalist of rare power, with pathos, beauty, and
variety in his notes, this bird has been, and would still be, a great favorite,
but for its transgressions among the pea-vines of our gardens. He makes
his appearance with exemplary punctuality, seeming regardless of the prematureness
or tardiness of the season. Rarely does the 10th of May pass
without the sound of his welcome notes, and rarely, if ever, does he come
sooner.</p>

<p>Their period of song is not a long one, but soon terminates, as family
cares increase and the tender broods require an undivided attention.
Early in July this Oriole ceases to favor the world with those remarkable
notes that seldom fail to attract attention by their peculiarity, and to excite
admiration by their rich and full-toned melody.</p>

<p>When the male Baltimores first arrive, they come unaccompanied by their
mates. At this time their notes are unusually loud, and their voices seem
shrill. Their song appears to partake somewhat of the nature of tender
lamentations and complaining. At this period they are very active and
restless, moving rapidly through the branches of the trees, just opening into
leaf and blossom, searching busily for the insects which then form their
principal food. When, a few days after their arrival, they are joined by the
females, the whole character of their song changes, which becomes a lower-toned,
richer, and more pleasing refrain. During their love-season their
resonant and peculiarly mellow whistle resounds in every garden and orchard,
along the highways of our villages, and in the parks and public squares of
our cities.</p>

<p>Nuttall, generally very felicitous in expressing by verbal equivalents the
notes of various species of our song-birds, describes the notes of its song as
running thus, <i class="birdcall">Tshippe-tshayia-too-too-tshippe-tshippe-too-too</i>, with several other
very similar modifications and variations. But these characters give a very
inadequate idea of their song. It must be heard to be appreciated, and no
description can do justice to its beauties. The notes are of an almost endless
variety, and each individual has his own special variations. The
female, too, has her own peculiar and very pretty notes, which she incessantly
warbles as she weaves her curiously elaborate nest.</p>

<p>To agriculturists this Oriole renders immense service in the destruction
of vast numbers of highly injurious insects; among the most noteworthy of
these are the common canker-worm and the tent caterpillars, both great
pests to orchards. These benefits far more than compensate for its annoying
attacks on the pods of esculent peas, the only sin that can rightfully be
brought against it, except, perhaps, the acts of theft committed against other
birds, in seizing upon and appropriating to it materials collected by smaller
birds for their nests.</p>

<p>The Baltimore Orioles are devoted, faithful, and courageous parents, resolutely
<!--224.png--><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 198]</span>
defending their young when in danger, and exposing themselves fearlessly
to danger and to death rather than forsake them. If their young are
taken and caged, the parents follow them, and, if permitted, will continue to
feed them.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway mentions an instance where the female entered her nest
while he was in the act of severing the limb from which it was suspended,
and persisted in remaining there until the nest had been cut off and taken
into the house. One of these birds, reared from the nest by a family in
Worcester, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, became perfectly domesticated, was allowed full liberty,
and even when taken by the married daughter of its mistress, perched on
her finger, through the open grounds to her own house, made no attempt to
escape. It delighted in occasional acts of mischief, especially in putting its
pointed bill through the meshes of the lace curtains, and then opening its
beak, seeming to enjoy the sound produced by tearing the threads.</p>

<p>In the construction of its nest the Oriole displays great skill and ingenuity.
This structure is a pendulous and nearly cylindrical pouch, suspended
from the extremity of some hanging branch. It is constructed by means of
the interweaving of the natural filaments of several flaxlike plants into a
homogeneous fabric of great strength, and admirably adapted to its purpose.
A nest of this species from West Florida, as well as the one figured by Audubon,
was made entirely of the long moss (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tillandsia usneoides</i>) so abundant
in Southern forests.</p>

<p>The young birds, before they can fly, climb to the edge of the nest, and
are liable, in sudden tempests, to be thrown out. If uninjured, they are
good climbers, and by means of wings, bill, and claws, are often able to
reach places of safety. In one instance a fledgling, which had broken both
legs, and was placed in a basket to be fed by its parents, managed, by wings
and bill, to raise itself to the rim, and in a few days took its departure.</p>

<p>The parents feed their young chiefly with caterpillars, which they apparently
swallow and then disgorge for this purpose. In confinement they feed
readily on soaked bread and fruit, and are especially fond of figs. They are
soon reconciled to confinement, become very docile and even playful, sing
readily, and will even come at a given signal and alight on the finger of
their master.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Baltimore are usually five and rarely six in number.
They are of an oblong-oval shape, pointed at one end, and measure .91 of an
inch in length by .60 in breadth. Their ground-color is white, with a slight
roseate tinge when fresh, fading into a bluish shade in time. They are all
variously marked, dotted, and marbled, with spots, blotches, and irregular
waving lines of purplish-brown. These markings are of greatly varying
shades, from a light purple to almost complete blackness, only perceptibly
purplish in a strong light.</p>

Tail very slightly graduated. Upper part of the head and neck, back,
wings, two central tail-feathers, line from base of bill through the eye to the black of the
nape, and a line from the base of the bill running to a point on the throat, black. Under
parts generally, sides of head and neck, forehead and line over the eye, rest of tail-feathers,
rump, and upper tail-coverts, yellow-orange. A broad band on the wings,
involving the greater and middle coverts, and the outer edges of the quills, white.
Young male with the black replaced by greenish-yellow, that on the throat persistent;
female without this. The first plumage of the young differs from that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">baltimore</i> in

<p>A closely allied Mexican species is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">I. abeillei</i> of Lesson, differing principally
in having the sides and rump black.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Bullock’s Oriole, the western counterpart of the eastern Baltimore,
is found throughout the Pacific shore, from the great Central Plains to
the ocean, and from Washington Territory to Mexico. It is not given by
Sumichrast as occurring in Vera Cruz, where its place is taken, as a migrant,
by the Baltimore. It was not noticed by Mr. Dresser on the Rio Grande,
but in Arizona it was found by Dr. Coues to be a common summer resident.
It was there seen to frequent, almost exclusively, the willows and cottonwoods
of the creek-bottoms. To the small twigs of these trees its pensile
nests were usually attached. It is said to arrive in Arizona late in April,
and to remain there nearly through September.</p>

<p>In the survey of the Mexican boundary Dr. Kennerly met with this
species in passing through Guadaloupe cañon, where it was often seen, but
it was observed at no other point on the route. It seemed to prefer the
low bushes on the hillside to the large trees. In its motions it was quick
and restless, passing rapidly from bush to bush.</p>

<p>In Washington Territory this species is stated by Dr. Suckley to be more
abundant in the sparsely wooded districts of the eastern base of the Cascade
Mountains than in the Coast Range. He found it exceedingly abundant at
Fort Dalles and along the eastern base of Mt. Adams. They arrive about
<!--226.png--><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 200]</span>
the 15th of May, and were very common among the low oaks of that region.
He speaks of its song as very pleasant, and especially melodious early in the
morning, when the bird is generally perched on the sunny side or top of
an oak.</p>

<p>At Puget Sound, according to Dr. Cooper, these birds do not arrive until
the beginning of June, and are at no time very common there. He describes
their habits as similar to those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spurius</i>, they being shy and difficult to
discover among the foliage. Their song is more like that of the Baltimore,
loud, clear, and varied.</p>

<p>In his Report on the birds of California, Dr. Cooper states that these birds
arrive at San Diego, from the south, about March 1; but at Fort Mohave, one
hundred and sixty miles farther north, he saw none until a month later.
Like the Baltimore Oriole, they resort to the open roads, gardens, and
orchards, putting themselves under the protection of man, and repaying him
both by their sweet melody and their usefulness in destroying insects. They
keep chiefly in the trees and rarely descend to the ground, except to collect
materials for their nests. These are suspended from the end of a branch,
and are constructed of fibrous grasses, horse-hairs, strings, bits of rags, wool,
hempen fibres of plants, etc. At times only a single material is used, such
as horse-hair. These nests are neatly and closely interwoven in the form of
a deep bag or purse, and are suspended by the edges from the forks of a
branch, near its end. They have usually a depth of about four or five
inches, and a diameter of about three or three and a half. In most cases
they are largely made of the flaxen fibres of wild hempen plants, and by
strings of this are firmly bound around the ends of the twigs to which
they are suspended. They are lined within with fine, soft vegetable down.
In some nests the inner bark of the silkweed largely predominates.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper states that the eggs of Bullock’s Oriole are, in number, from
four to six. He describes them as bluish-white, with scattered, winding
streaks and hair-lines of black and reddish-brown near the larger end,
measuring .98 by .60 of an inch. In the southern half of California they
are laid in the first or second week of May. At Santa Cruz, in 1866, he did
not observe any of this species until April 3.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen did not meet with this species in Western Kansas, and it is not
included in his list of birds observed by him near Fort Hays. At Ogden
and Salt Lake City, in Utah, which he reached the first of September, Bullock’s
Oriole had already migrated southward.</p>

<p>In all the fertile portions of the country west of the plains, Mr. Ridgway
found Bullock’s Oriole&mdash;the western representative of the Baltimore&mdash;extremely
abundant. In May, when the valley of the Truckee, near Pyramid
Lake, was visited, he observed great numbers feeding upon the buds of the
grease-wood, in company with the Louisiana Tanager and the Black-headed
Grosbeaks. In certain localities there was scarcely a tree that did not contain
one or more nests of these birds, and as many as five have been found in
<!--227.png--><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 201]</span>
a single tree. Although constructed in a manner almost precisely similar to
those of the common eastern species, its nest is less frequently pendulous,
being in many cases fixed between the upright twigs near the top of the tree.
It is, however, not unfrequently suspended, like that of the Baltimore, from
the extremity of a drooping branch, though very rarely in so beautiful
a manner. The notes of this Oriole, which are similar to those of the
Baltimore, are neither so distinct, so mellow, nor so strong, and their effect
is quite different from that produced by the splendid mellow whistling of
the eastern species; and the mellow, rolling chatter so characteristic of the
latter is not so full in the western species, and generally ends in a sharp
<i class="birdcall">chow</i>, much like the curious mewing of an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Icteria</i>. He regards Bullock’s
Oriole as altogether a less attractive species.</p>

<p>Mr. Lord found this bird by no means an abundant species in British
Columbia. Those that were seen seemed to prefer the localities where the
scrub-oaks grew, to the pine regions. He found their long, pendulous nests
suspended from points of oak branches, without any attempt at concealment.
He never met with any of these birds north of Fraser’s River, and very
rarely east of the Cascades. A few stragglers visited his quarters at Colville,
arriving late in May and leaving early in September, the males usually preceding
the females three or four days.</p>

<p>On the Shasta Plains Mr. Lord noticed, in the nesting of this bird, a
singular instance of the readiness with which birds alter their habits under
difficulties. A solitary oak stood by a little patch of water, both removed
by many miles from other objects of the kind. Every available branch and
spray of this tree had one of the woven nests of this brilliant bird hanging
from it, though hardly known to colonize elsewhere in this manner.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues, in an interesting paper on the habits of this species in the
Naturalist for November, 1871, states that its nests, though having a general
resemblance in their style of architecture, differ greatly from one another,
usually for obvious reasons, such as their situation, the time taken for their
construction, and even the taste and skill of the builders. He describes one
nest, built in a pine-tree, in which, in a very ingenious manner, these birds
bent down the long, straight, needle-like leaves of the stiff, terminal branchlets,
and, tying their ends together, made them serve as the upper portion
of the nest, and a means of attachment. This nest was nine inches long
and four in diameter.</p>

<p>Another nest, described by the same writer, was suspended from the forked
twig of an oak, and draped with its leaves, almost to concealment. It had
an unusual peculiarity of being arched over and roofed in at the top, with a
dome of the same material as the rest of the nest, and a small round hole on
one side, just large enough to admit the birds.</p>

<p>The eggs of this Oriole are slightly larger than those of the Baltimore, and
their ground-color is more of a creamy-white, yet occasionally with a distinctly
bluish tinge. They are marbled and marked with irregular lines and
<!--228.png--><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 202]</span>
tracings of dark umber-brown, deepening almost into black, but never so
deep as in the eggs of the eastern species. These marblings vary constantly
and in a remarkable degree; in some they are almost entirely wanting. They
measure .90 of an inch in length by .65 in breadth.</p>

Bill rather attenuated, as long as or longer than the head. The culmen curved,
the tip much bent down. The

to impart a somewhat tubular
appearance to each mandible.
The commissure sinuated. Tail
longer than the wings, usually
much graduated. Legs longer
than the head, fitted for walking.
Color of males entirely
black with lustrous reflections.</p>

<p>The bill of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quiscalinæ</i>
is very different from
that of the other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Icteridæ</i>, and is readily recognized by the tendency to a
rounding inward along the cutting edges, rendering the width in a cross
section of the bill considerably less along the commissure than above or
below. The culmen is more curved than in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agelainæ</i>. All the North
American species have the iris white.</p>

<p>The only genera in the United States are as follows:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The above characteristics will readily distinguish the genus from its allies.
The form is much like that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agelaius</i>. The bill, however, is more attenuated,
the culmen curved and slightly sinuated. The bend at the base of the

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Rusty Blackbird is an eastern species, found from the Atlantic
<!--230.png--><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 204]</span>
to the Missouri River, and from Louisiana and Florida to the Arctic
regions. In a large portion of the United States it is only known as a
migratory species, passing rapidly through in early spring, and hardly
making a longer stay in the fall. Richardson states that the summer
range of this bird extends to the
68th parallel, or as far as the woods
extend. It arrives at the Saskatchewan
in the end of April, and at
Great Bear Lake, latitude 65<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, by
the <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> of May. They come in pairs,
and for a time frequent the sandy
beaches of secluded lakes, feeding
on coleopterous insects. Later in
the season they are said to make
depredations upon the grain-fields.</p>

<p>They pass through Massachusetts
from the 8th of March to the first of
April, in irregular companies, none of
which make any stay, but move hurriedly
on. They begin to return early in October, and are found irregularly
throughout that month. They are unsuspicious and easily approached, and
frequent the streams and edges of ponds during their stay.</p>

<p>Mr. Boardman states that these birds are common near Calais, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr>, arriving
there in March, some remaining to breed. In Western Massachusetts, according
to Mr. Allen, they are rather rare, being seen only occasionally in
spring and fall as stragglers, or in small flocks. Mr. Allen gives as their
arrival the last of September, and has seen them as late as November 24.
They also were abundant in Nova Scotia. Dr. Coues states that in South
Carolina they winter from November until March.</p>

<p>These birds are said to sing during pairing-time, and become nearly silent
while rearing their young, but in the fall resume their song. Nuttall has
heard them sing until the approach of winter. He thinks their notes are
quite agreeable and musical, and much more melodious than those of the
other species.</p>

<p>During their stay in the vicinity of Boston, they assemble in large numbers,
to roost in the reed marshes on the edges of ponds, and especially in
those of Fresh Pond, Cambridge. They feed during the day chiefly on grasshoppers
and berries, and rarely molest the grain.</p>

<p>According to Wilson, they reach Pennsylvania early in October, and at
this period make Indian corn their principal food. They leave about the
middle of November. In South Carolina he found them numerous around
the rice plantations, feeding about the hog-pens and wherever they could
procure corn. They are easily domesticated, becoming very familiar in a few
days, and readily reconciled to confinement.</p>

<p><!--231.png--><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 205]</span>
In the District of Columbia, Dr. Coues found the Rusty Grakle an abundant
and strictly gregarious winter resident, arriving there the third week in
October and remaining until April, and found chiefly in swampy localities,
but occasionally also in ploughed fields.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon found these birds during the winter months, as far south as
Florida and Lower Louisiana, arriving there in small flocks, coming in company
with the Redwings and Cowbirds, and remaining associated with them
until the spring. At this season they are also found in nearly all the Southern
and Western States. They appear fond of the company of cattle, and
are to be seen with them, both in the pasture and in the farm-yard. They
seem less shy than the other species. They also frequent moist places,
where they feed upon aquatic insects and small snails, for which they search
among the reeds and sedges, climbing them with great agility.</p>

<p>In their habits they are said to resemble the Redwings, and, being equally
fond of the vicinity of water, they construct their nests in low trees and
bushes in moist places. Their nests are said to be similarly constructed,
but smaller than those of the Redwings. In Labrador Mr. Audubon found
them lined with mosses instead of grasses. In Maine they begin to lay
about the first of June, and in Labrador about the 20th, and raise only one
brood in a season.</p>

<p>The young, when first able to fly, are of a nearly uniform brown color.
Their nests, according to Audubon, are also occasionally found in marshes
of tall reeds of the <i class="plantname">Typha</i>, to the stalks of which they are firmly attached
by interweaving the leaves of the plant with grasses and fine strips of bark.
A friend of the same writer, residing in New Orleans, found one of these
birds, in full plumage and slightly wounded, near the city. He took it
home, and put it in a cage with some Painted Buntings. It made no attempt
to molest his companions, and they soon became good friends. It
sang during its confinement, but the notes were less sonorous than when
at liberty. It was fed entirely on rice.</p>

<p>The memoranda of Mr. MacFarlane show that these birds are by no means
uncommon near Fort Anderson. A nest, found June 12, on the branch of a
spruce, next to the trunk, was eight feet from the ground. Another nest,
containing one egg and a young bird, was in the midst of a branch of a pine,
five feet from the ground. The parents endeavored to draw him from their
nest, and to turn his attention to themselves. A third, found June 22, contained
four eggs, and was similarly situated. The eggs contained large
embryos. Mr. MacFarlane states that whenever a nest of this species is
approached, both parents evince great uneasiness, and do all in their power,
by flying from tree to tree in its vicinity, to attract one from the spot. They
are spoken of as moderately abundant at Fort Anderson, and as having been
met with as far east as the Horton River. He was also informed by the
Eskimos that they extend along the banks of the Lower Anderson to the
very borders of the woods.</p>

<p><!--232.png--><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 206]</span>
Mr. Dall states that these Blackbirds arrive at Nulato about May 20, where
they are tolerably abundant and very tame. They breed later than some
other birds, and had not begun to lay before he left, the last of May. Eggs
were procured at Fort Yukon by Mr. Lockhart, and at Sitka by Mr. Bischoff.</p>

<p>Besides these localities, this bird was found breeding in the Barren Grounds
of Anderson River in 69<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> north latitude, on the Arctic coast at Fort Kenai,
by Mr. Bischoff, and at Fort Simpson, Fort Rae, and Peel River. It has
been found breeding at Calais by Mr. Boardman, and at Halifax by Mr.
W. G. Winton.</p>

<p>Eggs sent from Fort Yukon, near the mouth of the Porcupine River, by
Mr. S. Jones, are of a rounded-oval shape, measuring 1.03 inches in length
by .75 in breadth. In size, shape, ground-color, and color of their markings,
they are hardly distinguishable from some eggs of Brewer’s Blackbird, though
generally different. All I have seen from Fort Yukon have a ground-color
of very light green, very thickly covered with blotches and finer dottings of
a mixture of ferruginous and purplish-brown. In some the blotches are
larger and fewer than in others, and in all these the purple shading predominates.
One egg, more nearly spherical than the rest, measures .98 by .82.
None have any waving lines, as in all other Blackbird’s eggs. Two from
near Calais, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr>, measure 1.02 by .75 of an inch, have a ground of light
green, only sparingly blotched with shades of purplish-brown, varying from
light to very dark hues, but with no traces of lines or marbling.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Boardman, these birds are found during the summer
months about Calais, but they are not common. Only a few remain of
those that come in large flocks in the early spring. They pass along about
the last of April, the greater proportions only tarrying a short time; but in
the fall they stay from five to eight weeks. They nest in the same places
with the Redwing Blackbirds, and their nests are very much alike. In early
summer they have a very pretty note, which is never heard in the fall.</p>

<p>Autumnal specimens do not exhibit the broad rusty edges of feathers seen
in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. ferrugineus</i>.</p>

<p>The females and immature males differ from the adult males in much the
same points as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. ferrugineus</i>, except that the “rusty” markings are less
prominent and more grayish. The differences generally between the two
species are very appreciable. Thus, in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. cyanocephalus</i>, the bill, though of
the same length, is much higher and broader at the base, as well as much
less linear in its upper outline; the point, too, is less decurved. The size is
every way larger. The purplish gloss, which in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferrugineus</i> is found on most
of the body except the wings and tail, is here confined to the head and
neck, the rest of the body being of a richly lustrous and strongly marked
green, more distinct than that on the wings and tail of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ferrugineus</i>. In one
specimen only, from Santa Rosalia, Mexico, is there a trace of purple on
some of the wing and tail feathers.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species was first given as a bird of our fauna by Mr. Audubon,
in the supplementary pages of the seventh volume of his Birds of
America. He met with it on the prairies around Fort Union, at the junction
of the Yellowstone and the Missouri Rivers, and in the extensive ravines
in that neighborhood, in which were found a few dwarfish trees and tall
rough weeds or grasses, along the margin of scanty rivulets. In these localities
he met with small groups of seven or eight of these birds. They were
in loose flocks, and moved in a silent manner, permitting an approach to
within some fifteen or twenty paces, and uttering a call-note as his party stood
watching their movements. Perceiving it to be a species new to him, he
procured several specimens. He states that they did not evince the pertness
so usual to birds of this family, but seemed rather as if dissatisfied with their
abode. On the ground their gait was easy and brisk. He heard nothing
from them of the nature of a song, only a single <i class="birdcall">cluck</i>, not unlike that of the
Redwing, between which birds and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. ferrugineus</i> he was disposed to
place this species.</p>

<p>Dr. Newberry found this Blackbird common both in California and in
Oregon. He saw large flocks of them at Fort Vancouver, in the last of October.
They were flying from field to field, and gathered into the large
spruces about the fort, in the manner of other Blackbirds when on the point
of migrating.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen found this Blackbird, though less an inhabitant of the marshes
than the Yellow-headed, associating with them in destroying the farmers’
<!--234.png--><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 208]</span>
ripening corn, and only less destructive because less numerous. It appears
to be an abundant species in all the settled portions of the western region,
extending to the eastward as far as Wisconsin, and even to Southeastern Illinois,
one specimen having been obtained in Wisconsin by Mr. Kumlien, and
others in Wabash <abbr title="County, Illinois">Co., Ill.</abbr>, by Mr. Ridgway.</p>

<p>In the summer, according to Mr. Ridgway, it retires to the cedar and
piñon mountains to breed, at that time seldom visiting the river valley.
In the winter it resorts in large flocks to the vicinity of corrals and barn-yards,
where it becomes very tame and familiar. On the <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> of June he
met with the breeding-ground of a colony of these birds, in a grove of
cedars on the side of a cañon, in the mountains, near Pyramid Lake.
Nearly every tree contained a nest, and several had two or three. Each
nest was saddled on a horizontal branch, generally in a thick tuft of foliage,
and well concealed. The majority of these nests contained young, and
when these were disturbed the parents flew about the heads of the intruders,
uttering a soft <i class="birdcall">chuck</i>. The maximum number of eggs or young
was six, the usual number four or five. In notes and manners it seemed
to be an exact counterpart of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. ferrugineus</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley found these birds quite abundant at Fort Dalles, but west of
the Cascade Mountains they were quite rare. At Fort Dalles it is a winter
resident, where, in the cold weather, it may frequently be found in flocks in
the vicinity of barn-yards and stables. Dr. Cooper also obtained specimens
of this Grakle at Vancouver, and regards it as a constant resident on the
Columbia River. He saw none at Puget Sound. In their notes and habits
he was not able to trace any difference from the Rusty Blackbird of the
Atlantic States. In winter they kept about the stables in flocks of fifties or
more, and on warm days flew about among the tree-tops, in company with
the Redwings, singing a harsh but pleasant chorus for hours.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper states it to be an abundant species everywhere throughout
California, except in the dense forests, and resident throughout the year.
They frequent pastures and follow cattle in the manner of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molothrus</i>.
They associate with the other Blackbirds, and are fond of feeding and bathing
along the edges of streams. They have not much song, but the noise
made by a large flock, as they sit sunning themselves in early spring, is said
to be quite pleasing. In this chorus the Redwings frequently assist. At
Santa Cruz he found them more familiar than elsewhere. They frequented
the yards about houses and stables, building in the trees of the gardens, and
collecting daily, after their hunger was satisfied, on the roofs or on neighboring
trees, to sing, for an hour or two, their songs of thanks. He has seen a
pair of these birds pursue and drive away a large hawk threatening some
tame pigeons.</p>

<p>This species has an extended distribution, having been met with by Mr.
Kennicott as far north as Pembina, and being also abundant as far south as
Northern Mexico. In the Boundary Survey specimens were procured at
<!--235.png--><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 209]</span>
Eagle Pass and at Santa <a name="note12" id="note12"></a>Rosalia, where Lieutenant Couch found them living
about the ranches and the cattle-yards.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser, on his arrival at Matamoras, in July, noticed these birds in
the streets of that town, in company with the Long-tailed Grakles <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Q. macrurus</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molothrus pecoris</i>. He was told by the Mexicans that they breed
there, but it was too late to procure their eggs. In the winter vast flocks
frequented the roads near by, as well as the streets of San Antonio and Eagle
Pass. They were as tame as European Sparrows. Their note, when on the
wing, was a low whistle. When congregated in trees, they kept up an incessant
chattering.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found them permanent residents of Arizona, and exceedingly
abundant. It was the typical Blackbird of Fort Whipple, though few probably
breed in the immediate vicinity. Towards the end of September they
become very numerous, and remain so until May, after which few are observed
till the fall. They congregate in immense flocks about the corrals,
and are tame and familiar. Their note, he says, is a harsh, rasping squeak,
varied by a melodious, ringing whistle. I am indebted to this observing
ornithologist for the following sketch of their peculiar characteristics:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blockquote">“Brewer’s Blackbird is resident in Arizona, the most abundant bird of its
family, and one of the most characteristic species of the Territory. It appears
about Fort Whipple in flocks in September; the numbers are augmented
during the following month, and there is little or no diminution
until May, when the flocks disperse to breed.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The nest is placed in the fork of a large bush or tree, sometimes at the
height of twenty or thirty feet, and is a bulky structure, not distantly resembling
a miniature Crow’s nest, but it is comparatively deeper and more compactly
built. A great quantity of short, crooked twigs are brought together
and interlaced to form the basement and outer wall, and with these is
matted a variety of softer material, as weed-stalks, fibrous roots, and dried
grasses. A little mud may be found mixed with the other material, but it
is not plastered on in any quantity, and often seems to be merely what adhered
to the roots or plant-stems that were used. The nest is finished
inside with a quantity of hair. The eggs are altogether different from those
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quiscali</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agelæi</i>, and resemble those of the Yellow-headed and
Rusty Grakles. They vary in number from four to six, and measure barely
an inch in length by about three fourths as much in breadth. The ground-color
is dull olivaceous-gray, sometimes a paler, clearer bluish or greenish
gray, thickly spattered all over with small spots of brown, from very dark
blackish-brown or chocolate to light umber. These markings, none of
great size, are very irregular in outline, though probably never becoming
line-tracery; and they vary indefinitely in number, being sometimes so
crowded that the egg appears of an almost uniform brownish color.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“In this region the Blackbirds play the same part in nature’s economy
that the Yellow-headed Troupial does in some other parts of the West, and
<!--236.png--><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 210]</span>
the Cowbird and Purple Grakle in the East. Like others of their tribe they
are very abundant where found at all, and eminently gregarious, except
whilst breeding. Yet I never saw such innumerable multitudes together as
the Redwinged Blackbird, or even its Californian congener, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. tricolor</i>, shows
in the fall, flocks of fifty or a hundred being oftenest seen. Unlike the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agelæi</i>, they show no partiality for swampy places, being lovers of the woods
and fields, and appearing perfectly at home in the clearings about man’s
abode, where their sources of supply are made sure through his bounty or
wastefulness. They are well adapted for terrestrial life by the size and
strength of their feet, and spend much of their time on the ground, betaking
themselves to the trees on alarm. On the ground they habitually run with
nimble steps, when seeking food, only occasionally hopping leisurely, like a
Sparrow, upon both feet at once. Their movements are generally quick,
and their attitudes varied. They run with the head lowered and tail somewhat
elevated and partly spread for a balance, but in walking slowly the
head is held high, and oscillates with every step. The customary attitude
when perching is with the body nearly erect, the tail hanging loosely down,
and the bill pointing upward; but should their attention be attracted, this
negligent posture is changed, the birds sit low and firmly, with elevated and
wide-spread tail rapidly flirted, whilst the bright eye peers down through
the foliage. When a flock comes down to the ground to search for food,
they generally huddle closely together and pass pretty quickly along, each
one striving to be first, and in their eagerness they continually fly up and
re-alight a few paces ahead, so that the flock seems, as it were, to be rolling
over and over. When disturbed at such times, they fly in a dense body to
a neighboring tree, but then almost invariably scatter as they settle among
the boughs. The alarm over, one, more adventurous, flies down again, two
or three follow in his wake, and the rest come trooping after. In their behavior
towards man, they exhibited a curious mixture of heedlessness and
timidity; they would ramble about almost at our feet sometimes, yet the
least unusual sound or movement sent them scurrying into the trees. They
became tamest about the stables, where they would walk almost under the
horses’ feet, like Cowbirds in a farm-yard.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Their hunger satisfied, the Blackbirds would fly into the pine-trees and
remain a long time motionless, though not at all quiet. They were at singing-school,’
we used to say, and certainly there was room for improvement
in their chorus; but if their notes were not particularly harmonious, they
were sprightly, varied, and on the whole rather agreeable, suggesting the
joviality that Blackbirds always show when their stomachs are full, and the
prospect of further supply is good. Their notes are rapid and emphatic, and,
like the barking of coyotes, give an impression of many more performers
than are really engaged. They have a smart chirp, like the clashing of pebbles,
frequently repeated at intervals, varied with a long-drawn mellow
whistle. Their ordinary note, continually uttered when they are searching
<!--237.png--><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 211]</span>
for food, is intermediate between the guttural <i class="birdcall">chuck</i> of the Redwing and the
metallic <i class="birdcall">chink</i> of the Reedbird.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“In the fall, when food is most abundant, they generally grow fat, and
furnish excellent eating. They are tender, like other small birds, and do
not have the rather unpleasant flavor that the Redwing gains by feeding too
long upon the <i class="plantname">Zizania</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“These are sociable as well as gregarious birds, and allied species are
seen associating with them. At Wilmington, Southern California, where I
found them extremely abundant in November, they were flocking indiscriminately
with the equally plentiful <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agelaius tricolor</i>.”</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann found this Blackbird very common in New Mexico and
Texas, though he was probably in error in supposing that all leave there before
the period of incubation. During the fall they frequent the cattle-yards,
where they obtain abundance of food. They were very familiar,
alighting on the house-tops, and apparently having no cause for fear of man.
Unlike all other writers, he speaks of its song as a soft, clear whistle.
When congregated in spring on the trees, they keep up a continual chattering
for hours, as though revelling in an exuberance of spirits.</p>

<p>Under the common Spanish name of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pajaro prieto</i>, Dr. Berlandier refers
in <abbr title="manuscript">MSS.</abbr> to this species. It is said to inhabit the greater part of Mexico, and
especially the Eastern States. It moves in flocks in company with the
other Blackbirds. It is said to construct a well-made nest about the end of
April, of blades of grass, lining it with horse-hair. The eggs, three or four
in number, are much smaller than those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quiscalus macrurus</i>, obtuse at
one end, and slightly pointed at the other. The ground-color is a pale gray,
with a bluish tint, and although less streaked, bears a great resemblance to
those of the larger Blackbird.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper states that these birds nest in low trees, often several in one
tree. He describes the nest as large, constructed externally of a rough frame
of twigs, with a thick layer of mud, lined with fine rootlets and grasses.
The eggs are laid from April 10 to May 20, are four or five in number,
have a dull greenish-white ground, with numerous streaks and small blotches
of dark brown. He gives their measurement at one inch by .72. They raise
two and probably three broods in a season.</p>

<p>Four eggs of this species, from Monterey, collected by Dr. Canfield, have
an average measurement of 1.02 inches by .74. Their ground-color is a
pale white with a greenish tinge. They are marked with great irregularity,
with blotches of a light brown, with fewer blotches of a much darker
shade, and a few dots of the same. In one egg the spots are altogether
of the lighter shade, and are so numerous and confluent as to conceal the
ground-color. In the other they are more scattered, but the lines and
marbling of irregularly shaped and narrow zigzag marking are absent in
nearly all the eggs.</p>

<p>Mr. Lord found this species a rare bird in British Columbia. He saw a
<!--238.png--><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 212]</span>
few on Vancouver Island in the yards where cattle were fed, and a small
number frequented the mule-camp on the Sumas prairie. East of the
Cascades he met none except at Colville, where a small flock had wintered
in a settler’s <a name="note23" id="note23"></a>cow-yard. They appeared to have a great liking for the presence
of those animals, arising from their finding more food and insects
there than elsewhere, walking between their legs, and even perching upon
their backs.</p>

<p>Captain Blakiston found this species breeding on the forks of the Saskatchewan,
June 3, 1858, where he obtained its eggs.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Specific Characters"><span class="sc">Sp. Char.</span></abbr>
Bill as long as the head, the culmen slightly curved, the gonys almost
straight; the edges of the bill inflected and rounded; the commissure quite strongly
sinuated. Outlines of tarsal scutellæ well defined on the sides; tail long, boat-shaped, or
capable of folding so that the two sides can almost be brought together upward, the
feathers conspicuously and decidedly graduated, their inner webs longer than the outer.
Color black.</p>

<p>The excessive graduation of the long tail, with the perfectly black color,
at once distinguishes this genus from any other in the United States. Two
types may be distinguished: one <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quiscalus</i>, in which the females are much
like the males, although a little smaller and perhaps with rather less lustre;
the other, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Megaquiscalus</i>, much larger, with the tail more graduated, the
females considerably smaller, and of a brown or rusty color. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quiscali</i>
are all from North America or the West Indies (including Trinidad); none
having been positively determined as South American. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Megaquiscali</i>
are Mexican and Gulf species entirely, while a third group, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Holoquiscali</i>,
is West Indian.</p>

<p>This form is more liable to
variation than any other, the arrangement
of the metallic tints
varying with the individual; there
is never, however, an approach
to the sharp definition and symmetrical
pattern of coloration characteristic
of the western race.</p>

<p>The female is a little less brilliant
than the male, and slightly smaller. The young is entirely uniform
slaty-brown, without gloss.</p>

<p>An extreme example of this race (22,526, Washington, D. C.?) is almost
wholly of a continuous rich purple, interrupted only on the interscapulars,
where, anteriorly, the purple is overlaid by bright green, the feathers with
terminal transverse bars of bluish. On the lower parts are scattered areas
of a more bluish tint. The purple is richest and of a reddish cast on the
neck, passing gradually into a bluish tint toward the bill; on the rump and
breast the purple has a somewhat bronzy appearance.</p>

as races. Yet these variations are so well marked and so constant that they
almost claim the right to be treated as specifically distinct. We shall consider
them by themselves. They are the Purple Grakle, or common Crow
Blackbird, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quiscalus purpureus</i>; the Bronzed Grakle, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Q. æneus</i>; and the
Florida Grakle, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Q. aglæus</i>.</p>

<p>The first of these, the well-known Crow Blackbird of the Atlantic States,
so far as we are now informed, has an area extending from Northern Florida
on the south to Maine, and from the Atlantic to the Alleghanies. Mr. Allen
states that the second form is the typical form of New England, but my observations
do not confirm his statement. Both the eastern and the western
forms occur in Massachusetts, but the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">purpureus</i> alone seems to be a summer
resident, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æneus</i> occurring only <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in transitu</i>, and, so far as I am now aware,
chiefly in the fall.</p>

<p>The Crow Blackbirds visit Massachusetts early in March and remain
until the latter part of September, those that are summer residents generally
departing before October. They are not abundant in the eastern part of the
State, and breed in small communities or by solitary pairs.</p>

<p>In the Central States, especially in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, they are
much more abundant, and render themselves conspicuous and dreaded by
the farmers through the extent of their depredations on the crops. The evil
<!--243.png--><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 217]</span>
deeds of all birds are ever much more noticed and dwelt upon than their
beneficial acts. So it is, to an eminent degree, with the Crow Blackbird.
Very few seem aware of the vast amount of benefit it confers on the farmer,
but all know full well&mdash;and are bitterly prejudiced by the knowledge&mdash;the
extent of the damages this bird causes.</p>

<p>They return to Pennsylvania about the middle of March, in large, loose
flocks, at that time frequenting the meadows and ploughed fields, and their
food then consists almost wholly of grubs, worms, etc., of which they destroy
prodigious numbers. In view of these services, and notwithstanding
the havoc they commit on the crops of Indian corn, Wilson states that he
should hesitate whether to consider these birds most as friends or as enemies,
as they are particularly destructive to almost all the noxious worms, grubs,
and caterpillars that infest the farmer’s fields, which, were they to be allowed
to multiply unmolested, would soon consume nine tenths of all the productions
of his labor, and desolate the country with the miseries of famine.</p>

<p>The depredations committed by these birds are almost wholly upon Indian
corn, at different stages. As soon as its blades appear above the ground,
after it has been planted, these birds descend upon the fields, pull up the
tender plant, and devour the seeds, scattering the green blades around. It is
of little use to attempt to drive them away with the gun. They only fly
from one part of the field to another. And again, as soon as the tender corn
has formed, these flocks, now replenished by the young of the year, once more
swarm in the cornfields, tear off the husks, and devour the tender grains. Wilson
has seen fields of corn in which more than half the corn was thus ruined.</p>

<p>These birds winter in immense numbers in the lower parts of Virginia,
North and South Carolina, and Georgia, sometimes forming one congregated
multitude of several hundred thousands. On one occasion Wilson met, on
the banks of the Roanoke, on the 20th of January, one of these prodigious
armies of Crow Blackbirds. They rose, he states, from the surrounding
fields with a noise like thunder, and, descending on the length of the road
before him, they covered it and the fences completely with black. When
they again rose, and after a few evolutions descended on the skirts of the
high timbered woods, they produced a most singular and striking effect.
Whole trees, for a considerable extent, from the top to the lowest branches,
seemed as if hung with mourning. Their notes and screaming, he adds,
seemed all the while like the distant sounds of a great cataract, but in a
more musical cadence.</p>

<p>A writer in the American Naturalist (<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> 326), residing in Newark, <abbr title="New York"><span class="sc">N. Y.</span></abbr>,
notes the advent of a large number of these birds to his village. Two built
their nest inside the spire of a church. Another pair took possession of a
martin-house in the narrator’s garden, forcibly expelling the rightful owners.
These same birds also attempted to plunder the newly constructed nests of
the Robins of their materials. They were, however, successfully resisted, the
Robins driving the Blackbirds away in all cases of contest.</p>

<p><!--244.png--><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 218]</span>
The Crow Blackbird nests in various situations, sometimes in low bushes,
more frequently in trees, and at various heights. A pair, for several years,
had their nest on the top of a high fir-tree, some sixty feet from the ground,
standing a few feet from my front door. Though narrowly watched by unfriendly
eyes, no one could detect them in any mischief. Not a spear of corn
was molested, and their food was exclusively insects, for which they diligently
searched, turning over chips, pieces of wood, and loose stones. Their
nests are large, coarsely but strongly made of twigs and dry plants, interwoven
with strong stems of grasses. When the Fish Hawks build in their
neighborhood, Wilson states that it is a frequent occurrence for the Grakles
to place their nests in the interstices of those of the former. Sometimes
several pairs make use of the same Hawk’s nest at the same time,
living in singular amity with its owner. Mr. Audubon speaks of finding
these birds generally breeding in the hollows of trees. I have never met
with their nests in these situations, but Mr. William Brewster says he has
found them nesting in this manner in the northern part of Maine. Both,
however, probably refer to the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æneus</i>.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Grakle exhibit great variations in their ground-color,
varying from a light greenish-white to a deep rusty-brown. The former is
the more common color. The eggs are marked with large dashes and broad,
irregular streaks of black and dark brown, often presenting a singular grotesqueness
in their shapes. Eggs with a deep brown ground are usually
marked chiefly about the larger end with confluent, cloudy blotches of deeper
shades of the same. The eggs measure 1.25 inches by .90.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Mississippi region of United States, east to Alleghany Mountains, west to Fort
Bridger; Saskatchewan Region, Hudson’s Bay Territory; Labrador? and Maine (52,382,
Calais, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr>, G. A. Boardman). More or less abundant in all eastern States north of New
Jersey.</p>

<p>This species may be readily distinguished from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Q. purpureus</i> by the
color alone, independently of the differences of proportions.</p>

<p>The impression received from a casual notice of a specimen of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Q. purpureus</i>
is that of a uniformly glossy black bird, the metallic tints being much
broken or irregularly distributed, being frequently, or generally, arranged in
successive bands on the feathers over the whole body, producing a peculiar
iridescent effect. In the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Q. æneus</i> nothing of this character is seen; for,
among a very large series of western specimens, not one has the body other
than continuous bronze, the head and neck alone being green or blue, and
this sharply and abruptly defined against the very different tint of the other
portions. These colors, of course, have their extremes of variation, but the
change is only in the shade of the metallic tints, the precise pattern being
strictly retained. In the present species the colors are more vivid and silky
than in the eastern, and the bird is, in fact, a much handsomer one.
(Ridgway.)</p>

<p>Just after moulting, the plumage is unusually brilliant, the metallic tints
being much more vivid.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Bronzed Blackbird has been so recently separated from the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">purpureus</i> that we cannot give, with exactness or certainty, the area over
which it is distributed. It is supposed to occupy the country west of the
Alleghanies as far to the southwest as the Rio Grande and Fort Bridger, extending
to the Missouri plains on the northwest, to the Saskatchewan in the
north, and to Maine and Nova Scotia on the northeast. Subsequent explorations
may somewhat modify this supposed area of distribution. It is at
least known that this form occurs in Texas, in all the States immediately
west of the Alleghanies, and in the New England States, as well as the
vicinity of New York City.</p>

<p>In regard to its habits, as differing from those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">purpureus</i>, we are without
any observations sufficiently distinctive to be of value. It reaches
Calais about the first of April, and is a common summer visitant.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1869, about the 10th of October, several weeks after the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quiscali</i> which had been spending the summer with us had disappeared, an
unusually large number of these birds, in the bronzed plumage, made their appearance
in the place; they seemed to come all together, but kept in smaller
companies. One of these flocks spent the day, which was lowering and
unpleasant, but not rainy, in my orchard. They kept closely to the ground,
and seemed to be busily engaged in searching for insects. They had a single
<!--246.png--><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 220]</span>
call-note, not loud, and seemingly one of uneasiness and watchfulness against
danger. Yet they were not shy, and permitted a close approach. They
remained but a day, and all were gone the following morning. On the day
after their departure, we found that quite a number of apples had been
bitten into. We had no doubt as to the culprits, though no one saw them
in the act.</p>

<p>Audubon’s observations relative to the Crow Blackbird are chiefly made
with reference to those seen in Louisiana, where this race is probably the only
one found. The only noticeable peculiarity in his account of these birds is
his statement that the Blackbirds of that State nest in hollow trees, a manner
of breeding now known to be also occasional in the habits of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">purpureus</i>.
The eggs of this form appear to exhibit apparently even greater variations
than do those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">purpureus</i>. One egg, measuring 1.10 inches by
.85, has a bright bluish-green ground, plashed and spotted with deep brown
markings. Another has a dull gray ground, sparingly marked with light
brown; the measurement of this is 1.13 inches by .85. A third has a
greenish-white ground, so profusely spotted with a russet-brown that the
ground-color is hardly perceptible. It is larger and more nearly spherical,
measuring 1.16 inches by .90. A fourth is so entirely covered with blotches,
dots, and cloudings of dark cinnamon-brown that the ground can nowhere
be traced.</p>

<p>Mr. Gideon Lincecum, of Long Point, Texas, writes, in regard to this
species, that, in his neighborhood, they nest in rookeries, often on a large live
oak. They build their nests on the top of large limbs. In favorable situations
four or five nests can be looked into at once. They are at this time
full of song, though never very melodious. The people of Texas shoot them,
believing them to be injurious to their crops; but instead of being an injury
they are an advantage, they destroy so many worms, grasshoppers, caterpillars,
etc. They are migratory, and very gregarious. They all leave Texas in the
winter, and the same birds return in the spring to the same nesting-places.
They lay five eggs in a nest.</p>

<p>In Southern Illinois, as Mr. Ridgway informs me, these birds are resident
throughout the year, though rather rare during the winter months. They
breed in the greatest abundance, and are very gregarious in the breeding-season.
On a single small island in the Wabash River, covered with tall
willows, Mr. Ridgway found over seventy nests at one time. These were
<a name="note13" id="note13"></a>placed indifferently on horizontal boughs, in forks, or in excavations,&mdash;either
natural or made by the large Woodpeckers (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hylotomus</i>),&mdash;nests in
all these situations being sometimes found in one tree. They prefer the
large elms, cottonwoods, and sycamores of the river-bottoms as trees for
nesting-places, but select rather thinly wooded situations, as old clearings,
etc. In the vicinity of Calais, according to Mr. Boardman, they nest habitually
in hollow stubs in marshy borders of brooks or ponds.</p>

<p>This race is quite well marked, though it grades insensibly into the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">purpureus</i>. It differs from both that and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æneus</i> in much smaller size, with
more slender and more decurved bill.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the colors is much as in the larger western species,
while the tints are most like those of the eastern. All the colors are, however,
darker, but at the same time softer than in either of the others.</p>

<p>In form this species approaches nearest the western, agreeing with it in
the primaries, slender bill, and more graduated tail, and, indeed, its relations
in every respect appear to be with this rather than the eastern.</p>

<p>This race was first described from specimens collected at Key Biscayne
by Mr. Wurdemann, in April, 1857, and in 1858, and is the smallest of the
genus within our limits. The wing and tail each are about an inch shorter
than in the other varieties of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">purpureus</i>. The bill, however, is much longer
and more slender, and the tip considerably more produced and decurved.
The feet are stouter and much coarser, the pads of the toes very scabrous,
as if to assist in holding slippery substances, a feature scarcely seen in

tinge. They average 1.17 inches in length by .85 in breadth, are more oblong

and Houston, Texas (<span class="sc">Dresser</span>, Ibis, 1865, 494).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Boat-tailed Grakle, or Jackdaw, of the Southern States, is
found in all the maritime portions of the States that border both on the
Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, from North Carolina to Rio Grande. In
Western Texas it does not seem to be abundant. Lieutenant Couch met
with only a single specimen at Brownsville, in company with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Q. macrurus</i>.
Mr. Dresser, when at Houston and at Galveston in May and June, 1864, noticed
several of these birds. Mr. Salvin mentions finding them as far south
as the Keys of the Belize coast.</p>

<p>We learn from the observations of Mr. Audubon that this species is more
particularly attached to the maritime portions of the country. It rarely
goes farther inland than forty or fifty miles, following the marshy banks of
the larger streams. It occurs in great abundance in the lower portions of
Louisiana, though not found so high up the Mississippi as Natchez. It also
abounds in the Sea Islands on the coast of the Carolinas, and in the lowlands
of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues states that this species hardly occurs in any abundance north of
the Carolinas, and that it is restricted to a narrow belt along the coast of the
ocean and gulf, from North Carolina throughout our entire shore to Mexico.
He supposed it to stop there, and to be replaced by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">macrurus</i>. Though
the larger proportion of these birds pass beyond our southern boundaries to
spend the winter, a few, chiefly old males, are resident in North Carolina
throughout the year. In the spring the females are the first to appear. Just
before the mating has taken place, the flocks of these birds are said to execute
sudden and unaccountable evolutions, as if guided by some single commanding
spirit; now hovering uncertain, then dashing impulsive, now veering
in an instant, and at last taking a long, steady flight towards some distant
point. During this period, Dr. Coues further informs us, their voices crack,
and they utter a curious medley of notes from bass to falsetto, a jingling,
unmusical jargon that is indescribable.</p>

<p>The laying-season is said to be at its height during the latter part of
April. He found in no instance more than six eggs in a nest, nor less
than three. He thinks that they have two, and perhaps three, broods in
a season, as he found it not uncommon to meet with newly fledged birds
in September.</p>

<p>These birds are eminently gregarious at all seasons of the year, and at
certain seasons assemble in large flocks. They are omnivorous, eating both
insects and grain, and are alternately benefactors and plunderers of the
<!--252.png--><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 224]</span>
planters. In the early season they seek their food among the large salt
marshes of the seaboard, and along the muddy banks of creeks and rivers.
They do great damage to the rice plantations, both when the grain is in the
soft state and afterwards when the ripened grain is stacked. They also feed
very largely upon the small crabs called fiddlers, so common in all the mud
flats, earthworms, various insects, shrimps, and other aquatic forms of the
like character.</p>

<p>A few of these birds are resident throughout the year, though the
greater part retire farther south during a portion of the winter. They
return in February, in full plumage, when they mate. They resort, by pairs
and in companies, to certain favorite breeding-places, where they begin to
construct their nests. They do not, however, even in Florida, begin to breed
before April. They build a large and clumsy nest, made of very coarse
and miscellaneous materials, chiefly sticks and fragments of dry weeds,
sedges, and strips of bark, lined with finer stems, fibrous roots, and grasses,
and have from three to five eggs.</p>

<p>It is a very singular but well-established characteristic of this species,
that no sooner is their nest completed and incubation commenced than the
male birds all desert their mates, and, joining one another in flocks, keep
apart from the females, feeding by themselves, until they are joined by the
young birds and their mothers in the fall.</p>

<p>These facts and this trait of character in this species have been fully confirmed
by the observations of Dr. Bachman of Charleston. In 1832 he
visited a breeding-locality of these birds. On a single Smilax bush he found
more than thirty nests of the Grakles, from three to five feet apart, some
of them not more than fifteen inches above the water, and only females were
seen about the nests, no males making their appearance. Dr. Bachman also
visited colonies of these nests placed upon live-oak trees thirty or forty feet
from the ground, and carefully watched the manners of the old birds, but
has never found any males in the vicinity of their nests after the eggs had
been laid. They always keep at a distance, feeding in flocks in the marshes,
leaving the females to take charge of their nests and young. They have but
one brood in a season.</p>

<p>As these birds fly, in loose flocks, they continually utter a peculiar cry,
which Mr. Audubon states resembles or may be represented by <i class="birdcall">kirrick, crick,
crick</i>. Their usual notes are harsh, resembling loud, shrill whistles, and are
frequently accompanied with their ordinary cry of <i class="birdcall">crick-crick-cree</i>. In the
love-season these notes are said to be more pleasing, and are changed into
sounds which Audubon states resemble <i class="birdcall">tirit, tirit, titiri-titiri-titirēē</i>, rising
from low to high with great regularity and emphasis. The cry of the young
bird, when just able to fly, he compares to the whistling cry of some kind
of frogs.</p>

<p>The males are charged by Mr. Audubon with attacking birds of other
species, driving them from their nests and sucking their eggs.</p>

<p><!--253.png--><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 225]</span>
Dr. Bryant, who found this species the most common bird in the neighborhood
of Lake Monroe, adds that it could be seen at all times running along
the edge of the water, almost in the manner of a Sandpiper. They were
breeding by hundreds in the reeds near the inlet to the lake. On the 6th
of April some of the birds had not commenced laying, though the majority
had hatched, and the young of others were almost fledged.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species measure 1.25 inches in length by .92 in breadth.
Their ground-color is usually a brownish-drab, in some tinged with olive, in
others with green. Over this are distributed various markings, in lines, zigzags,
and irregular blotches of brown and black.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Great-tailed or Central American Grakle is an abundant
species throughout Mexico and Central America, and probably extends to
some distance into South America. In Vera Cruz, Sumichrast states it to
be one of the few birds that are found in nearly equal abundance throughout
the three regions, hot, temperate, and alpine, into which that department is
physically divided. It is abundant everywhere throughout that State, and
also nests there. In the neighborhood of Cordova and Orizaba it lives in
large communities, a single tree being often loaded with the nests.</p>

<p><!--254.png--><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 226]</span>
On the Rio Grande it extends into Texas, and thus qualifies itself for a
place within our fauna. A few specimens were procured at Eagle Pass and
elsewhere by the Mexican Boundary Survey party. It is more abundant
on the western banks of the Rio Grande, especially at Matamoras. Among
the MS. notes left by Dr. Kennerly is a part of the memoranda of the
late Dr. Berlandier of that place. Under the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pica elegans</i> the latter
refers to what is evidently this species. He describes it as found in
all parts of the Republic of Mexico, where it is known as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Uraca</i>, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pajaro
negro</i>, and, in Acapulco, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Papate</i>. It is found, he adds, abundantly throughout
the State of Tamaulipas. It lives upon grain, especially corn, devouring
the planted seeds and destroying the crops. It builds its nest in April,
laying its eggs in the same month, and the young birds are hatched out by
the beginning of May. The nests are large, the edges high, and the cavity
correspondingly deep. They are constructed of dry plants and small bits
of cloth, which the birds find about the settlements, and the bottom of the
nest is plastered with clay, which gives it great firmness. This is covered
with grasses and pieces of dry weeds. The eggs are described as large, of a
pale leaden-gray or a rusty color, over which are black marks, stripes, lines,
and spots without order or regularity. They are generally four in number.
The nests are built on the tops of the highest trees, usually the willows
or mesquites.</p>

<p>Mr. G. C. Taylor, in his notes on the birds of Honduras, states that he
found this Blackbird common, and always to be met with about the villages.
It appeared to be polygamous, the males being generally attended by
several females. A fine male bird, with his accompanying females, frequented
the court-yard of the Railroad House at Comayagua, where Mr.
Taylor was staying. They generally sat on the roof of the house, or among
the upper branches of some orange-trees that grew in the yard. They had
a very peculiar cry, not unlike the noise produced by the sharpening of a
saw, but more prolonged.</p>

<p>Mr. Salvin found the bird very abundant in Central America. In one of
his papers relative to the birds of that region, he states that this species, in
Guatemala, plays the part of the European House Sparrow. It seeks the
abode of man, as does that familiar bird, and is generally found frequenting
larger towns as well as villages. Stables are its favorite places of resort,
where it scratches for its food among the ordure of the horses. It will
even perch on the backs of these animals and rid them of their ticks,
occasionally picking up stray grains of corn from their mangers. At Duenas
he found it breeding in large societies, usually selecting the willows that
grow near the lake and the reeds on the banks for its nest. The breeding
season extends over some length of time. In May, young birds and fresh
eggs may be found in nests in the same trees. On the coast, young birds,
nearly capable of flying, were seen in the early part of March. Mr. Salvin
adds that the nests are usually made of grass, and placed among upright
<!--255.png--><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 227]</span>
branches, the grass being intwined around each twig, to support the structure.
The eggs in that region were seldom found to exceed three in number.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser found the Long-tailed Grakles very common at Matamoras,
where they frequented the streets and yards with no signs of fear. They
were breeding there in great quantities, building a heavy nest of sticks,
lined with roots and grass. They were fond of building in company, and in
the yard of the hotel he counted seven nests in one tree. At Eagle Pass,
and as far east as the Nueces River, he found them not uncommon, but
noticed none farther in the interior of Texas. Their usual note is a loud
and not unmelodious whistle. They have also a very peculiar guttural note,
which he compares to the sound caused by drawing a stick sharply across
the quills of a dried goose-wing.</p>

<p>Captain McCown states that he observed these Blackbirds building in
large communities at Fort Brown, Texas. Upon a tree standing near the
centre of the parade-ground at that fort, a pair of the birds had built their
nest. Just before the young were able to fly, one of them fell to the ground.
A boy about ten years old discovered and seized the bird, which resisted
stoutly, and uttered loud cries. These soon brought to its rescue a legion of
old birds, which vigorously attacked the boy, till he was glad to drop the bird
and take to flight. Captain McCown then went and picked up the young
bird, when they turned their fury upon him, passing close to his head and
uttering their sharp caw. He placed it upon a tree, and there left it, to the
evident satisfaction of his assailants. These birds, he adds, have a peculiar
cry, something like tearing the dry husk from an ear of corn. From this
the soldiers called them corn-huskers. He often saw other and smaller birds
building in the same tree. They were very familiar, and would frequently
approach to within ten feet of a person.</p>

<p>The eggs measure 1.32 inches in length by .92 of an inch in breadth, and
exhibit great variations both in ground-color and in the style and character
of their marking. In some the ground-color is of a light grayish-white with
a slight tinge of green or blue; in others it is of a light drab, and again many
have a deep brownish-drab. The markings are principally of a dark brown,
hardly distinguishable from black, distributed in the shape of drops, or
broad irregular narrow plashes, or in waving zigzag lines and markings. Intermingled
with these deeper and bolder markings are suffused cloud-like
colorations of purplish-brown.</p>

it otherwise characterizes the Old World exclusively. There are several

Europe and North Africa, most abundant in Holland. One specimen killed in
Greenland, in 1851, and preserved in the Royal Zoölogical Museum of Copenhagen.</p>

<p>The preceding description will serve to distinguish the Starling from any
North American species, although it is subject to considerable variation.
A second form, scarcely distinguishable as a species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. unicolor</i>, De la
Marmora), of a prevailing black color, without terminal spots, and with the
feathers of the under part elongated, is found in Sardinia and Sicily.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> We give a place to the common Starling of Europe in the fauna
of North America, as an occasional and rare visitant of Greenland. Only a
single instance is on record of its actual capture,&mdash;a female taken by Holböll
in 1851, and now in the Royal Museum of Copenhagen.</p>

<p>The well-known Starling of Europe is handsome in plumage and of graceful
shape. It is numerous, as a species, is very generally distributed, and
therefore very well known. With many it is a great favorite, and is also
familiar as a caged bird. Its sprightly habits, retentive memory, and flexibility
of voice, commend it as an interesting and entertaining pet. It has
been taught to whistle tunes, and even to imitate the human voice, with
facility and correctness. In its natural state it is a very social bird, and
lives in flocks the greater part of the year.</p>

<p>Mr. Waterton, who was a great admirer of the Starling, sought to induce
these birds to frequent his grounds, and with this view made various cavities
in the walls of an old tower near his residence. His wishes were gratified,
and soon every cavity he had made was taken possession of by a pair,
and many more would have been thus domiciled had provision been made
for them.</p>

<p>A similar instance is on record in Hamburg, where, within a few years,
a well-known horticulturist induced nearly two hundred pairs of Starlings
to occupy and to breed in wooden boxes put up in his grounds for their
accommodation. His plants had been destroyed by the attacks of hosts of
subterranean larvæ, and the Starlings were invited in the hope that they
would remove this evil, which they did quite effectually.</p>

<p>Dr. Beverley Morris gives a very interesting account of a female Starling
that he observed building a nest in a hollow tree. The male looked on, but
<!--258.png--><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 230]</span>
took no part, except to drive away other intrusive birds. The female made
on an average three trips a minute, with small twigs and bits of dry grass,
taking sometimes three or four at a time. He estimated that in the space
of six hours she had taken to her nest not less than a thousand sticks.</p>

<p>The Starling is said to select for its nest suitable places in church-steeples,
the eaves of houses, and holes in walls, especially of old towers and ruins;
occasionally it builds in hollow trees, in cliffs or in high rocks overhanging
the sea, and also in dovecotes. The nests are made of slender twigs, straw,
roots, and dry grasses. The birds incubate sixteen days. The old birds are
devoted to their offspring.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as the nestlings are able to fly, different families unite to
form large flocks, which may be seen feeding on commons and grass-grounds,
in company with the Rooks and other birds. Their chief food consists of
larvæ, worms, insects in various stages, and, at times, berries and grain. In
confinement they are very fond of raw meat.</p>

<p>Mr. Yarrell, quoting Dr. Dean of Wells, gives an account of an extraordinary
haunt of Starlings on an estate of a gentleman who had prepared
the place for occupation by Pheasants. It was in a plantation of arbutus
and laurustinus, covering some acres, to which these birds repaired, in the
evening, almost by the million, coming from the low grounds about the
Severn. A similar instance is given by Mr. Ball, of Dublin, of an immense
swarm of several hundred thousand Starlings sleeping every night in a mass
of thorn-trees at the upper end of the Zoölogical Garden in Phœnix Park.</p>

<p>The Starlings are found throughout Great Britain, even to the Hebrides
and the Orkneys, where they are great favorites, and holes are left in the
walls of the houses for their accommodation. They are common throughout
Norway, Sweden, and the north of Europe, and as far east as the Himalayas
and even Japan. They are also found in all the countries on both
sides of the Mediterranean, and Mr. Gould states that they occur in Africa
as far south as the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Starling are five in number, of a uniform delicate pale
blue, oval in shape and rounded at one end; they measure 1.20 inches in
length by .88 in breadth.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Characteristics"><span class="sc">Char.</span></abbr>
Primaries ten; the first short, generally about half as long as the second (or a
little more); the outer four sinuated on the inner edge. The nasal fossæ and nostrils
usually more or less concealed by narrow, stiffened bristles (or bristly feathers), with
short appressed lateral branches extending to the very tip, all directed forwards (these
bristles occasionally wanting). Tarsi scutellate anteriorly, the sides undivided (except
sometimes below), and separated from the anterior plates by a narrow naked strip, sometimes
filled up with small scales. Basal joint of middle toe united about equally to the
lateral, generally for about half the length. Bill generally notched.</p>

<p>The preceding characters distinguish the family of Crows quite markedly
from all others. The features of the bristles on the bill, and the separation
of the lateral and anterior scales by a narrow interval, are worthy of particular

<p>There are two sub-families of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corvidæ</i> represented in America, one embracing
the true Crows, the other the Jays. They pass very insensibly into each
other, and it is difficult to mark the dividing line. We may, however, distinguish
these, as found in the United States, by the following characters:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="small"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corvinæ.</b> Bill as long as the head. Tail short, nearly even; wings long and pointed,
longer than tail, and nearly reaching its tip; projecting beyond the under tail-coverts,
which reach the middle of tail. Tip of wing formed by the third, fourth, and fifth quills,
which are longest.</p>

<p class="small"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Garrulinæ.</b> Bill usually shorter than head. Tail lengthened, rounded, and generally
longer than the wings, which are short, rounded, and extend scarcely beyond the lower
tail-coverts; these not reaching the middle of the tail. Tip of wing formed by the fourth,
fifth, and sixth quills, which are longest.</p>

<p>The row of small scales is usually present on both sides of the tarsi in
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Corvinæ</i>, but in the Jays is generally restricted to the inner face.</p>

Rictus without bristles. Bill nearly as long as the tarsus, very stout; much
higher than broad at the base; culmen much arched. Wings reaching nearly or quite to
the tip of the tail, the outer four primaries sinuated internally. Tarsi longer than the
middle toe, with a series of small scales on the middle of each side separating the anterior
scutellate portion from the posterior continuous plates. Sides of the head occasionally
with nearly naked patches. Tail graduated or rounded.</p>

<p>Though easily distinguishable from the European bird, the American Raven
is so nearly related to it as to be beyond doubt referrible to it as a variety.
The differences presented in a very large series of both forms are, however,
very constant and tangible. In the American bird the bill is always longer
and less deep, and the plumage is more highly burnished, while the wings,
especially the secondaries, are perceptibly of a more reddish violet than
the other portions. Though in an immense series of American specimens
many differences of form and size are noted, yet there is nothing sufficiently
characteristic of any particular region to indicate more than one variety.
As a rule, however, specimens
from the high
north exceed in size
those from elsewhere,
and have the bill more
robust, though not so
short as in the European
bird; while those from
the Middle Province and
Mexico to Guatemala
(= “<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cacalotl</i>,” Baird et
<abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Auctor"><span class="sc">Auct.</span></abbr>) have the plumage
more brilliant than others,
and frequently the
bill very narrow.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Assuming
that we must consider
as but one species the
two differing forms of
Raven found in North America, we find this bird more or less common
throughout nearly the whole continent. It is much more abundant in some
regions than in others, and, as a general rule, is much more common and
also more generally distributed in the western portion, where also its habits
are remarkably different from the manners of its eastern representative.</p>

<p>It seems to be more or less common throughout the Arctic regions.
Mr. Kennicott met with Ravens at Lake Winnipeg. Mr. MacFarlane found
them abundant at Lockhart River, at Fort Anderson, and on the Lower
Anderson River. Mr. Ross obtained them at Fort Simpson, Mr. Reid at
<!--266.png--><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 236]</span>
Big Island, Mr. Clarke at Fort Rae, Mr. Lockhart at Fort Resolution, and
Mr. Dall at Nulato, in Alaska.</p>

<p>Richardson speaks of it as abounding in the fur countries, where it frequents
the barren grounds even in the intense winter cold, and where its
movements are regulated by those of reindeer, musk-oxen, and other animals,
which it follows, to assist in devouring whatever may be killed.
Ravens are seen to collect from various quarters wherever any animal is
slain, in order to feast on the offal, and considerable numbers are in constant
attendance upon the several fishing-stations. He mentions a singular
instance of the disposition of this bird to appropriate glittering objects of
no value to it for food or anything else. A Raven was seen flying off
with something in its claws, pursued by a number of its clamorous companions.
Having been fired at, it dropped the object of contention, which
proved to be the lock of a chest.</p>

<p>Mr. MacFarlane’s notes in regard to the nesting of these birds describe certain
variations as to position, etc. One nest was on a ledge of a cliff of shale,
and was composed of dry willow sticks, lined with pieces of rabbit skin and
the hair of moose. Both parents were seen,&mdash;one on the nest, the other
on a tree,&mdash;but both flew away on being approached. A second nest was in
the top crotch of a tall pine on the river-bank. It was made of dry sticks,
and thickly lined with reindeer hair. There were eight eggs in this nest.
A third was in a tall pine, and was forty-five feet from the ground. It was
constructed in a manner precisely similar to the preceding. A fourth was
on the top of a tall pine, and only differed in having been lined with dry
grass, moss, and a few reindeer hairs. The other nests appear to have been
similarly situated and constructed. Nearly all were in high trees, built of
dry sticks, and lined with dry grasses, mosses, and the hair of various quadrupeds.
The maximum number of eggs was eight, their average six.</p>

<p>Mr. MacFarlane states that the Raven is found throughout the winter in
the Arctic regions, and that, though he has met with it north of latitude 69<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>,
he has never known it to breed north of that line. He informs us that it is
seldom that more than a single pair is to be seen at a time, and occasionally
they may be noted singly, flying alone, or feeding on garbage. Sometimes
a dead fox or wolf will attract quite a number to the spot. On one occasion
he observed as many as twenty Ravens amicably associated together around
the carcasses of two wolves that had been poisoned with strychnine. In
many cases he has known the partaking of a poisoned animal prove fatal
to them, as also the eating of bait laid for foxes and wolves.</p>

<p>According to this same correspondent, one of these birds became almost
domesticated at Fort Anderson, during February and March, 1865. At first it
fed about the fort with a companion; soon after, coming alone, it grew bolder
and bolder, alighted within the square, allowed itself to be closely approached,
where the young dogs soon became familiar with it, and would even frolic
and gambol with it, the Raven joining heartily in the sport in its own way.
<!--267.png--><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 237]</span>
It was never known to attempt to injure even the smallest of the young
dogs, nor did any of the dogs ever offer to annoy it. It at length came to
be considered by all as an inmate of the establishment. While it seemed to
have full confidence in the people of the fort, it kept at a careful distance
from all Indian or Esquimaux visitors.</p>

<p>Mr. B. R. Ross speaks of Ravens as common as far north as the Arctic
Ocean. They feed on carrion, and act as scavengers to the establishments.
Their sight is remarkably keen, and the sagacity with which they follow the
trapper is wonderful. Early as the hunter may start, these harpies will have
been before him, and torn out the eyes and entrails of each hare. They will
break into marten-traps for the sake of the bait or the captured animal,
thrusting aside or pulling out with their beaks the sticks that compose the
enclosure. Sometimes they are caught in steel traps that are set for foxes,
or eat the strychnine baits laid for the same animals, and slowly succumb to
this powerful poison. Their flesh is so rank that even a fox, unless sorely
pressed by hunger, will not eat it. They pair in April, and usually construct
their nests in the loftiest trees. They have various call-notes, one of
which is like that of the Canada Goose, and another is said by Mr. Ross to
be very liquid and musical.</p>

<p>Mr. Dall states that these birds were abundant all the year at Nulato, and
indeed everywhere throughout Alaska, but much more common near the
Indian villages and trading-posts than elsewhere. They build on the sandstone
cliffs at Nulato, in cavities that have been occupied for years. They
lay about the 20th of April, and the young are hatched before open water.
He also speaks of them as very intelligent, and states that on several expeditions
made to obtain their eggs, the instant he stopped at the foot of
the bluff the whole colony would arrange themselves on the edge of the
rock in anxious consultation, uttering repeated cries of warning. On one
occasion, where the nest was inaccessible and the party went back unsuccessful,
their departure was announced by significant and joyous croaks
and derisive screeches. Ravens were also found by Mr. Bannister common
all the year on the small islands lying off the northeast point of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michaels.</p>

<p>In the Eastern States the Raven is a comparatively rare bird, except in a
few special localities. These are usually mountain-ranges, high precipitous
banks of rivers and lakes and of the ocean, and among wild and lonely
islands. It occurs on the Labrador coast, at Grand Menan in the Bay of
Fundy, the Adirondacks, Lake George, the Hudson River, etc. Mr. Lawrence
speaks of it as quite common on the coast of New Jersey. It is
found among the mountains of Buncombe and other counties in North
Carolina, and Mr. Audubon mentions its occurrence at Table Mountain, in
the district of Pendleton, South Carolina. Dr. Coues found Ravens not rare
at Labrador, where the almost inaccessible cliffs afford them safe and convenient
retreats. They were so excessively wary that it was found impossible
<!--268.png--><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 238]</span>
to shoot them. They descended in pairs to the sea-shore to feed on
dead fish, crabs, and other animal substances thrown up by the sea.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway informs me of the presence of this bird in the heavy forests
of the bottom-lands in Southern Illinois. It is there quite rare, however,
as he has met with but a few pairs. These were resident, and nested in the
tall timber of the Big Creek bottoms, in Richland <abbr title="County">Co.</abbr></p>

<p>Audubon’s party found it equally impossible to obtain a specimen at Labrador.
One afternoon Mr. Audubon hid himself under a nest several hours,
to no purpose. The old Ravens would not show themselves while he was
within gunshot, though the young clamored for food. As soon as he had
left the spot the female alighted on the nest, fed her young, and was off
again before she could be approached.</p>

<p>At Grand Menan, where they are not rare, and where they breed among
the high cliffs, I found them so wild that it was almost impossible even to
obtain sight of them. Passing high in the air above our heads, their loud,
hoarse croak attested their alarm at the sight of their enemy, man. They
are looked upon with aversion by the islanders, and are persecuted by them
without mercy. They rob the nests of the Herring Gulls, interfering with
the islanders in this privilege, and are, wrongfully I believe, charged with
destroying young lambs.</p>

<p>Years afterwards, when I again encountered individuals of this species at
Cheyenne, on the Plains, I could not but notice the immense difference in
their character. There perfect confidence in man took the place of dread.
Unmolested by the people, who regard them as desirable scavengers, valueless
for food and useful in removing nuisances, they were as tame and familiar
as the European Sparrow in the parks of New York or Boston. On one
occasion I found one engaged in eating the remains of a dead cow just outside
the city. It allowed me to approach to within five or six feet, when
with a very stately and dignified stride it moved out of my way, and kept
me at about this distance. I could not compel it to fly to any distance,
even when I hastened my steps.</p>

<p>In New England these birds are very rare, and their occurrence is only
accidental. One has been shot on the Connecticut, and another on the Merrimack,
in Massachusetts. They are not unfrequently met with in Northern
New York.</p>

<p>On the Pacific Coast the Raven is common from Sitka to San Diego.
Throughout Washington Territory it is said to be plentiful, more scattered
in the summer, and in the winter congregating about settlements and the
sea-shore. At Vancouver, during the winter, it was observed amicably associating
with the Crows, and on the coast with the Fish Crows, but during
the spring, when the latter had nests, they boldly attacked the Ravens, and
drove them away.</p>

<p>In California and in all the adjacent regions, Dr. Cooper states, the Raven
is found everywhere in pairs, more numerous than in the Atlantic States,
<!--269.png--><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 239]</span>
and abundant even in the most barren desert districts. It follows trains and
herds of cattle, and keeps on the lookout for anything befalling them. It is
omnivorous, eating snakes, lizards, eggs, carrion, and even grain, though the
last very rarely. It is accused of destroying young chickens and lambs.</p>

<p>In Arizona Dr. Coues speaks of it as resident, and very abundant about
the cattle enclosures, where it congregates in immense numbers during the
autumn and winter. During the severe winter of 1864-65 great numbers
perished of cold and hunger at Fort Whipple. Dr. Coues has favored us
with the following interesting sketch of the habits of this bird as observed
by him in that Territory.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The geographical distribution of the Raven seems to be in great measure
complementary to that of the Crow. On the prairies, in the desert,
among the mountains, of the Western States and Territories, where the
Ravens and their congenial companions, the coyotes, abound, the Crows are
rare or wanting altogether. In travelling westward, I saw no Crows after
leaving the settlements this side of the Plains, while the Ravens were conspicuous,
until in some parts of Southern California Crows reappeared, but
no Ravens amongst them. I saw a fair number of Ravens along the Arkansas
River, and they were frequent in the valley of the Rio Grande; after
crossing the river, while traversing the wild region thence to the Colorado,
they were our inseparable companions; hundreds, if not thousands, of them
lived about Fort Whipple all the year, seemingly attracted from miles
around by probabilities of finding abundant food. Throughout the Western
wilds they hang on the footsteps of man, needy adventurers, claiming their
share of his spoils, disputing with the wolves and vultures for the refuse of
his camp, and polishing the skeletons of the buffalo, with which he sometimes
strews the plain. The more desolate the land, the closer the Raven
follows in the trail of the emigrant, till its dismal croaking sounds ominous
of hardship, and its plumage seems to foreshadow days as dark.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“One accustomed to the shrewdness and prudence of Crows in populous
districts is at first surprised at an apparent familiarity the Raven often
shows in the West. There no one would think of wasting ammunition on
the worthless bird, and it comes to look upon man more as its provider than
as an enemy. Nevertheless, like the rest of its tribe, the Raven is a sagacious
bird, not likely to be twice deceived, and very ready to take a hint;
he always has his wits about him, and keeps a bright lookout when anything
stranger than a coyote is near. This wariness is something altogether different
from the childlike timidity of little birds like Sparrows, that scurry
away in terror from any unusual sight or sound, and unquestionably implies
keen powers of observation coupled with no small degree of reasoning
faculty. Almost every day during the winter of 1864-65 I must have
passed within a few paces of Ravens stalking about the fort; and yet, when
I wanted a specimen, it was not an easy matter to secure one. The birds
assuredly knew the difference between a person going quietly about his business
<!--270.png--><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 240]</span>
and one “on mischief bent,” and their intelligent watchfulness rendered
it quite impossible to approach them openly with gun in hand.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Ravens are resident in the region about Fort Whipple, and their apparently
diminished number in summer is simply due to the fact that they are
then spread over a greater surface, are less restless, and better provided for
in the matter of food. In winter, and especially when snow covered the
ground, their numbers at the fort were simply incalculable. They dotted
the ground everywhere during the day, and roosted in crowds on the neighboring
pines by night. One patriarchal tree, that stood somewhat isolated,
was a favorite resting-place for the Ravens and Buzzards, and gradually assumed
a singular appearance, as if it had been whitewashed. This great pine
overlooked a little open space where our beeves were slaughtered, and the
banqueting there was never ended. All night long the wolves howled and
barked as they tugged at the offal, till daylight sent them reluctant to their
rocky fastnesses, when the great dark birds, with a premonitory stretching
of the wings, flapped down to renew the feast. The Ravens and Buzzards
seemed to get along very well together, quarrelling no more with each other
than each species did with its own kind; but in the occasional disputes the
smaller birds seemed to have rather the advantage of the heavier and clumsier
gluttons. This comparative good-fellowship was in striking contrast to
the behavior of Crows towards Turkey Buzzards.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The Raven is not, on the whole, so noisy a bird as the Crow, though he
croaks vigorously on occasion, and his caw may claim to be impressive, if not
agreeable. But the queer sounds that the bird can utter, if he be so minded,
are indescribable; even his ordinary cawing is susceptible of considerable
modulation. A favorite amusement of his, when, his hunger appeased for
the time, he feels particularly comfortable, is to settle snugly on the top of
a pine-tree, and talk to himself. The performance generally begins with a
loud caw, self-asserting, followed by a complacent chuckle; and then comes
a series of comical syllables, so low as to be scarcely audible from the ground
below, as if he were musing aloud, and tickled with his own fancies. Then
he will raise his voice again, and file away at some old saw for a while, finishing
with the inimitable ‘cork-drawing’ for which his tribe is famous.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“A Raven that I had slightly wounded in the wing and captured soon
became quite tame, and developed a variety of amusing traits. Proving
rather obtrusive and inconvenient in my narrow quarters, I undertook to tie
him in a corner with a string round his leg. This he objected to, and it
was astonishing to see the perseverance he showed in untying any number
of knots I might make. It was a task that sometimes took him hours, but
he never rested until it was done. I had no chain light enough for the purpose,
but I finally got the better of him by twisting a wire with the cord.
His intelligence did not reach in that direction more than six inches from
his leg.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser observed the Raven common at San Antonio, frequenting the
<!--271.png--><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 241]</span>
slaughter-houses. In November, in the Baudera Hills, several came to his
camp to feast on the offal of deer. Dr. Woodhouse also found them very
abundant in Texas, the Indian Territory, and New Mexico, and especially
so on the buffalo plains. In the Mexican Boundary Survey, Dr. Kennerly
observed these birds everywhere in Northern Mexico, flocks of them following
the train from point to point. They were not at all shy, but often came
into camp in search of food.</p>

<p>Captain Blakiston, having enjoyed unusual opportunities for observing the
habits of the American Raven during his residence in high northern regions,
characterizes the species as anything but solitary. During the day they are
usually met with in pairs, except when drawn together in large numbers
around the carcass of a dead animal. At night, during the winter, they
repair to some chosen resting-place, usually a clump of trees on the edge of
a prairie, and there roost in one immense body. One of these roosting-places
was about a mile from Fort Carlton, and Captain Blakiston’s attention was
first drawn to it by noticing that about sunset all the Ravens, from all quarters,
were flying towards this point. Returning to the fort in the evening by
that quarter, he found a clump of aspen-trees, none of them more than
twenty-five feet high, filled with Ravens, who, at his approach, took wing
and flew round and round. He also noted the wonderful regularity with
which they repaired to their roosting-place in the evening and left it again
in the morning, by pairs, on their day’s hunt. They always left in the morning,
within a minute or two of the same time, earlier and earlier as the days
grew longer, on cold or cloudy mornings a little later, usually just half an
hour before sunrise. In April they all paired off, and their roosting-place
became deserted. During an excursion about one hundred and fifty miles
southwest of Fort Carlton, Captain Blakiston found several nests of Ravens
with eggs, one of which was in a small tree near a lake, and was not more
than fifteen feet above it. It contained six eggs, was about a foot in diameter,
composed of sticks, and was lined with buffalo-hair and pieces of scarlet
cloth, evidently picked up about an Indian camping-ground.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann states that while in California he always found the nests
of the Raven placed high on bold precipitous cliffs, secure against danger;
in the vast desolate plains of New Mexico he saw these birds building on
low trees, and even on cactus-plants, less than three feet from the ground,
showing how much circumstances and localities affect the habits of birds
regarding incubation.</p>

<p>A Raven, probably this species, is abundant on the plateau of Mexico.
The Cerro Colorado, near Tehuacan, is the rendezvous of a large number of
these birds, where, according to Sumichrast, at the time of the flowering of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">maguey</i>, they gather in great abundance, to feed on the blossoms of this
plant, which are their favorite food.</p>

<p>Mr. Boardman writes me that he has several times collected Ravens’ eggs
at Grand Menan, but always found the nest a hard one to take, as they
<!--272.png--><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 242]</span>
usually build it under some high cliff. They make a very large and bulky
nest, and, where not disturbed, use it several years in succession. They
also breed very early. He once took a nest with eight eggs on the 10th
of April, when the snow all around was quite deep. This was sent to
the Smithsonian Institution. Its contents nearly filled a bushel basket.
He does not regard the Ravens as migratory. Though they are apparently
more numerous in winter than in summer, this is probably because they
forsake the woods and come about the open fields and the banks of rivers
for dead fish, and thus are more noticed. They are very shy, sagacious, and
vigilant, so much so that it is almost impossible for one to get a shot at
them. Crows avoid them, and the two are never seen together. The farmers
of Grand Menan accuse them of pecking the eyes out of young lambs, and
always try to destroy them, and they grow less and less numerous every
year. The Ravens, he adds, appear to be on good terms with the Duck
Hawks, as he has known a nest of the former within a few rods of one of
the latter.</p>

<p>An egg of this species, from Anderson River, measures 1.96 inches in
length by 1.32 in breadth. Two from Grand Menan measure, one 2.05 inches
by 1.30, the other 1.95 by 1.25. The ground-color of two of these is a
soiled sea-green, that of the third is a light bluish-green. This is more sparingly
marked with dots, blotches, and cloudings of faint purple and purplish-brown,
chiefly at the larger end. The others are marked over the entire egg
with blotches of varying size and depth of coloring, of a deep purple-brown;
some of the markings are not readily distinguishable from black.</p>

<!--273.png--><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 243]</span>
White-necked Raven we have very little knowledge. It was first described
by Lieutenant Couch, in 1854, from specimens obtained by him at Charco
Escondido, Mexico, in May, 1853. Other specimens were afterwards procured
by Dr. Kennerly, at Janos, Mexico, in 1855, and by Mr. Dresser at
Eagle Pass, Texas, in March, 1864. The latter gives no notes as to its
habits.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly’s note in regard to it is that it was not very common, and
when seen was generally associated with the larger species of Raven. Lieutenant
Couch merely mentions it as found in small numbers in Eastern
Tamaulipas, generally near ranches.</p>

<p>Mr. J. H. Clark writes that this species does not seem to possess the
cunning or wariness of its congeners. It was met with, in the greatest
abundance, about watering-places. It was not found habitually in great
flocks, though at the head of the Limpia many were congregated and flying
about the face of an immense rocky mountain wall, where they were
probably nesting. Their note he describes as coarse, and less shrill than
that of the common Crow. He met with the supposed nest in an arborescent
cactus.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues does not appear to have met with this species in Arizona, but
Lieutenant Bendire writes to Professor Baird from Tucson, April 12, 1872,
that it is the most common Crow or Raven there. This he discovered
accidentally, finding that three fourths of the Ravens he shot proved to be
of this species; the others were the Colorado race of the Raven. Specimens
of this Crow were obtained at Fort Buchanan by Dr. Irwin, at Pecos
River by Dr. Anderson, and in the Indian Territory by Mr. McCarthy.</p>

<p>An egg of this species, from Trout Creek, Texas, obtained June 20 by
Charles S. McCarthy, measures 1.75 inches in length by 1.25 in breadth.
The ground-color is a light grayish-green, and is pretty uniformly marked
with fine dottings of mingled purple and brown.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. americanus</i> has no analogue in Europe, though the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. corone</i> somewhat
resembles it. The most important feature of distinction appears to lie
in the structure of the feathers of the head and neck, which in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. corone</i> are
narrow, with the tips distinct, while in the American bird these tips are
blended together and do not maintain their individuality. The feathers on
the fore-neck in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corone</i> are also <a name="note14" id="note14"></a>lanceolate and distinct, showing the outline
of each one as in the Raven, while in the American Crow they are three
times as broad, rounded, and entirely blended. Mr. Audubon further
remarks that the neck of the European bird is glossed with green and blue,
while that of the American has a decided purplish-brown tinge.</p>

<p>Prince Maximilian states, in addition, that the note differs in the two
species.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Common Crow of North America is found in great abundance
in all the Eastern States, from Texas to Florida, and from the Missouri
to Nova Scotia. A few are found beyond the Great Plains, and they also
extend their migrations, in summer, into high Arctic regions. Richardson
found them as far north as the 55th parallel, but was in error when he stated
that beyond this they do not go. He adds that none approach within five or
six hundred miles of Hudson’s Bay. They were observed at Cross Lake and
at Lake Winnepeg by Mr. Kennicott, at Big Island by Mr. Reid, at Fort
Rae by Mr. Clarke, and at Fort Anderson and on the Lower Anderson River
by Mr. MacFarlane, who also found them breeding even at this high latitude.
They were not seen in Russian America, and Dr. Cooper thinks that the
species does not occur in California, or, if at all, only rarely, but that it is
there replaced by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. caurinus</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway found the Crow of very rare occurrence in the interior. A
very few were seen in the Truckee meadows, in November, and others at the
Humboldt marshes, in October. These western birds were exceedingly unsuspicious
and familiar, so much so that those seen in the Humboldt marshes
were walking about with all the familiarity of domestic pigeons, only hopping
aside as they were approached. None were seen either in spring or
summer.</p>

<p>In Western Iowa Mr. Allen states that he saw but very few of this species,
and even in Northern Illinois it was not very common. At the West
this bird is reported to be held in better estimation than at the East, by the
farmers. It is not known to pull corn, and seems to be entirely unsuspicious.
It is regarded generally as a benefactor, and not only deserves, but
receives, good treatment. In Indiana he found it more common.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues met with a single individual on the Labrador coast. In Nova
Scotia it is much more abundant, and there, as on the Western prairies, being
unmolested by the inhabitants, it is exceedingly unsuspicious, and will permit
<!--275.png--><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 245]</span>
a very near approach before it will fly, and even then will not move
to a distance. In all of the United States east of the Mississippi it is very
abundant. In Texas, between San Antonio and the Mexican frontier, it is
not common; but Mr. Dresser found it very common in the northeast part
of the State during the whole year.</p>

<p>Probably no one of our birds, so wholly worthless for food, has been more
hunted and destroyed than this species. In certain parts of the country it
is held in great aversion by the farmers, and in some States bounty-laws
have been enacted by legislatures to promote its destruction. Had not
these birds been possessed of an extraordinary intelligence, they must long
since have been exterminated or driven from a large part of the country.
In some sections their numbers have been of late much diminished by the
use of strychnine. During the month of May the Crow is very destructive
in the cornfield, pulling up the grains as soon as they begin to vegetate, and
compelling the farmer to replant perhaps several times. Wilson remarks that
in the State of Delaware these birds collect in immense flocks and commit
great devastation upon crops of standing corn. They also occasionally commit
depredations in the <a name="note11" id="note11"></a>barn-yard, robbing hens’-nests of their eggs, and
even destroying young chickens. They also destroy the eggs and young of
other birds. The mischief they thus do is doubtless very great, and the
ground for the prevalent prejudice against them is quite apparent. Yet it is
equally demonstrable that this bird is surpassed, and probably is equalled,
by no other in the vast amount of the benefits conferred upon agriculturalists.
The evil it perpetrates is very limited, and is confined to but a short
period, but during all the time it is resident the Crow is constantly engaged
in the destruction of injurious insects and rodent quadrupeds. In the early
spring it feeds almost wholly upon the most destructive grubs, and in
extensive districts of Massachusetts, where these birds have been largely
destroyed, the ravages of the May-bugs and the grasshoppers in pasture-lands
have been a natural consequence of so short-sighted a policy.</p>

<p>The persecutions to which the Crow is subjected have developed in them
a wariness and a distrust that is foreign to their nature. They can only live
by keeping on a constant lookout for dangers, and by learning to distinguish
the weapons that threaten their destruction. As soon as anything is seen
that causes alarm, the signal is at once given, and the warning passed from
one to another.</p>

<p>In New Jersey and in Pennsylvania, during the winter months, the Crows
assemble in immense flocks, and their movements appear to be regulated by
the guidance of a few chosen leaders. I received from the lips of the late
John Cassin, an ornithologist hardly less remarkable for his outdoor observations
than for his researches in the closet, only a few days before his
death, a very surprising account of the movements of a large army of Crows,
witnessed by himself, in the spring of 1868.</p>

<p>On a Sunday morning in April, when Philadelphia was enveloped in a
<!--276.png--><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 246]</span>
fog so dense and impenetrable that it was hardly possible to distinguish objects
across its streets, Mr. Cassin’s attention was called to an immense
accumulation of these birds in Independence Square. The whole park he
found, to his utter astonishment, occupied by an immense army of Crows.
They filled all the trees, bending down the overloaded branches, and swarmed
over and covered the ground. The entire space seemed alive with Crows.
They had evidently become bewildered in the fog, and had strangely taken
refuge in this small park in the very heart of Philadelphia. As if aware of
their close proximity to danger, the whole assembly was quiet, orderly, and
silent. A few birds, evidently acting as leaders, moved noiselessly back and
forth through their ranks, as if giving tacit signals. These movements were
followed by the departure of a few scouts, as if sent to make explorations,
but they soon returned unsuccessful. Again were repeated the uneasy
movements of their leaders, passing slowly and cautiously through their
close ranks. After an apparently much longer consultation, another small
party ascended to explore, wheeling round and round in wider and wider
zones. At length, satisfied with their observations, they quietly returned,
and made their report in a manner evidently understood, though not audibly
expressed; for immediately the leaders passed again among the crowd, and,
as if signals were given for a general movement, the whole of this immense
congregation, numbering, Mr. Cassin estimated, hundreds of thousands, rose
slowly and silently, preceded by their scouts, and, moving off in a westerly
direction, were soon lost to view.</p>

<p>When taken young, the Crow can be easily domesticated, and becomes a
very entertaining, but a very mischievous pet. It is very secretive, hiding
objects of no value to itself, and seems to delight in mischief. It displays
often a wonderful intelligence, appears to understand and to obey certain
directions, and manifests also remarkable quickness of vision. A tame Crow
belonging to a family resident near Boston, and permitted to go at large,
manifested all the attachment of a dog. It especially enjoyed the society
of the children, and played with them in their games of hide and seek, surpassing
them by its readiness in finding the secreted object. It was especially
attached to the mistress of the house, flying to her whenever she
approached, hovering over her head, and alighting on her shoulder.</p>

<p>In a few instances the Crow has been taught to imitate articulate sounds.
In one of these, in Grafton, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, the Crow not only vociferated a single
monosyllable repeatedly, but at other times enunciated a short sentence of
five syllables.</p>

<p>A few are resident in Massachusetts during the year, but the greater portion
move south in November and return in March. Those who remain
during the winter are chiefly resident near the sea-shore. The Crow breeds
from April to June, varying with the latitude of its residence. In Massachusetts
it has full-grown young by June 1. It builds, usually in March, a
large rudely constructed nest of sticks, moss, and bark, lined with finer
<!--277.png--><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 247]</span>
mosses, and sometimes with hair. The parent birds are very watchful and
vigilant if their nest is in danger, and often expose their lives in their anxiety
for their young. The male bird is attentive to his mate during incubation,
and assists in feeding the young. The young are fed chiefly on insects,
frogs, mice, and similar food.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Crow vary from 1.60 to 1.55 inches in length, and from
1.20 to 1.10 in breadth. In their markings they exhibit surprising variations.
They usually have a ground of a light sea-green, over which are
scattered, more or less thickly, blotches, some of them quite large, of a dark-brown,
almost black, with purplish reflections. These are chiefly about the
larger end. Another quite common variety is of a deeper ground of green,
very uniformly and thickly sprinkled with fine dottings of a sepia-brown.
Others have a ground nearly white, slightly tinged with green, more sparingly
spotted with small blotches of light purplish-brown. A nest found
near Springfield contained eggs having the ground-color on one side a
pinkish-gray, the rest being greenish-white, all spotted with brown.
Another set of eggs from Hudson, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, were of a light bluish-green,
entirely unspotted, resembling large Robin’s eggs; and Dr. Wood mentions
another four, the ground of which was flesh-color, and the spots red.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Southern peninsula of Florida.</p>

<p>This resident Crow of Florida differs in some marked features from that
of the more northern localities in several characters. Although perhaps
rather smaller, the bill and feet, especially the latter, are very considerably
larger. The nasal feathers extend over the basal two fifths of the bill,
instead of the half. The proportions of the bill are about the same; in
the Florida bird it is rather the longer. The greatest difference is in the
feet. The tarsal joint of the tibia is bare, the feathers scarcely coming
below it, even anteriorly, instead of projecting some distance. The tarsus
is almost a quarter of an inch longer, covered anteriorly by nine scutellæ,
instead of eight. The outer lateral toe is shorter, not reaching the base
of the middle claw. The middle toe and claw are considerably shorter than
the tarsus; the middle claw is shorter than in the northern bird.</p>

<p>The wing-formula differs somewhat; the third, fourth, and fifth quills are
nearly equal, the third even longer than the fifth, instead of shorter. The
<!--278.png--><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 248]</span>
tail is short and very nearly even, the difference in length of feathers being
less than half an inch, instead of an inch. This, however, may in part be
owing to the absence of the middle pair.</p>

<p>The colors differ somewhat from those of the common Crow. There is
less violet, and the feathers of the back have almost a brassy gloss on their
margins, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crotophaga</i>.</p>

<p>The specimen upon which these remarks are based, though apparently
perfectly mature, is changing some of its feathers, such as the inner primaries,
the middle tail-feathers, and the greater coverts. The long primaries
and ten tail-feathers, however, are of full length. It is possible that the
bird is really as large as the northern Crow, although this is hardly probable.
It was killed on the mainland of the extreme southern portion of Florida,
not far from Fort Dallas.</p>

<p>No comparison of this bird is required with the Fish Crow, which has the
middle toe and claw longer than the tarsus, not shorter, and the proportions
much less.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common resident Crow of Florida exhibits so many peculiarities
differing from the northern species, that Professor Baird, in his
Birds of America, deemed it worthy of mention at least as a race, if not a
distinct species. We have no account of its habits, and do not know if,
in any respects, they differ from those of the common Crow. Dr. J. C.
Cooper, in his brief manuscript notes on the birds of Florida, made in the
spring of 1859, speaks of the Florida Crow as very common, as being quite
maritime in its habits, and as having full-fledged young on the 20th of
April. Three eggs of this race, obtained in Florida in the spring of 1871,
by Mr. Maynard, differ not more from those of the Crow than do those of the
latter occasionally from one another. They measure 1.73 by 1.20 inches;
1.70 by 1.20; and 1.54 by 1.25. Their ground-color is a bright bluish-green,
and they are all more or less marked, over the entire egg, with blotches of a
mingled bronze and brown with violet shadings. The latter tints are more
marked in one egg than in the others, and in this the spots are fewer and
more at one end, the larger end being nearly free from markings. Their
average capacity, as compared with the average of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. americanus</i>, is as
5.1 to 4.2.</p>

Fourth quill longest; fifth and third about equal; second longer than sixth;

<p><!--279.png--><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 249]</span>
This species is readily distinguished from the eastern Fish Crow by the
larger size; the absence of green gloss on the belly; the tarsi longer than
the middle toe and claw, instead of shorter; and the second quill being
generally shorter than the sixth instead of longer, and considerably shorter
than the culmen, instead of longer.</p>

<p>It is rather to be compared with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. americanus</i>, with which it agrees in
colors, but from which it differs, essentially, in having the wing and tail
very much shorter, while the bill is considerably longer, and in having the
tarsus shorter than the culmen, instead of longer, as in all the other North
American species. In this last respect it agrees with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. mexicanus</i> (see
synopsis, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 829) of Western Mexico; in this, however, the color and proportions
are entirely different.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species appears to be confined to the seaboard of the Pacific,
from Alaska to California inclusive. Smaller than the common Crow,
in its more essential features it closely resembles that bird, while in all its
habits it appears the exact counterpart of the Fish Crow, from which it is
specifically and essentially distinct.</p>

<p>It is found as far north as Sitka, several specimens having been procured
at that point by Mr. Bischoff.</p>

<p>In the opinion of Dr. Suckley, the marked differences in the habits of
this species from those of the common Crow, even more than the great difference
in size, sufficiently mark them as entirely distinct. The western
Fish Crow is never wary or suspicious, like the common species, but in its
impudent familiarity with man resembles the English Jackdaw, and hardly
learns to be shy even after having been annoyed with the gun. In Oregon
and Washington Territory, he states, this Crow is very abundant, and is one
of the marked ornithological features of the country. The great abundance
of fish, especially of salmon, in both of these divisions, amply supplies this
species with food. At Puget Sound it is abundant throughout the year.
During the winter it subsists principally upon the refuse food and offal
thrown out by the natives from their lodges. He describes it as cunning,
but very tame and impudent, allowing a very near approach, and retiring but
a short distance when pursued. Like the Raven and the Herring Gull, these
birds are in the habit of carrying clams high into the air and then dropping
them, in order to break the shell. Dr. Suckley observed one fruitlessly trying
to break the shell of a clam by letting it drop on soft ground. In this
effort he persisted perseveringly as long as he was watched.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley found a nest of this species at Fort Dalles. It was situated
in a dense willow-thicket, near a lagoon on the Columbia, and contained
three eggs. He describes them as about an inch and a half long, and very
wide in their short diameter, of a dirty green ground with brown spots.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper speaks of it as much more gregarious and familiar than the
common Crow, but otherwise resembling that bird in habits, being very sagacious,
feeding upon almost everything animal and vegetable, differing rather
<!--280.png--><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 250]</span>
in the tone than in the character of its cries. Its chief dependence for
food being on the sea, it is generally found along the beach, devouring dead
fish and other objects thrown up by the waves. At high tide the birds leave
the shore and resort to dwellings near the sea, where they devour the offal
and any refuse, vegetable or animal. As soon as the tide changes they are
sure to notice it and to return to their favorite feeding-ground. They are
very troublesome to the Indians, stealing their fish exposed for drying, and
other articles of food. From some superstitious awe of them the Indians
never molest these birds, but set their children to watch and drive them
away. They build in trees near the shore, and the young are fledged in May.</p>

<p>In the southern half of California, Dr. Cooper states, these birds are
rarely seen near the sea, preferring inland districts, and only occasionally
coming to the shores of the bays to feed. During most of the year they
associate in large flocks, feeding in company, and are gregarious even in the
breeding-season, building in close proximity to one another. Frequently
several nests may be found on the same tree. In this respect they are very
unlike the eastern species, which never permit another pair near their nest.</p>

<p>These birds were found by Dr. Cooper breeding as far south as San Diego,
where they selected for their breeding-places the groves of evergreen oaks
growing in ravines. Their nests were from twelve to forty feet from the
ground. In the north they generally build in spruces. He describes their
nests as strongly built of sticks, coarse on the outside, but finer on the inside,
where they are mingled with roots, grasses, moss, horse-hair, etc., to form a soft
lining. The eggs, four in number, have a ground-color of a dark shade of green,
thickly marked with dark brown and olive. He gives their average measurement
as 1.60 by 1.10 inches. At San Diego they are laid about April 15.</p>

<p>Where unmolested, these birds have not yet become so shy as in the older
districts, but they soon learn to apprehend the danger of a gun, and to evince
the cunning characteristics of their tribe. They have not, as yet, manifested
any disposition to disturb the growing crops, and the small depredations they
commit are far more than counterbalanced by their destruction of immense
numbers of grubs, grasshoppers, and other injurious insects. They obtain a
large supply of food around the cattle-ranches.</p>

<p>In northern California they feed largely on fish, and on the Columbia on
clams and oysters.</p>

<p>For reasons not well understood, they avoid particular districts during the
breeding-season. Dr. Cooper has never noticed one, during this season, on
the coast south of Santa Clara, has never seen one in the Colorado Valley,
nor in the Sierra Nevada.</p>

<p>At Visalia, where an extensive forest of oaks forms an oasis in the great
Tulare plain, he met with large flocks of these birds, with the same gregarious
habits as were observed on the coast.</p>

<p>During the month of July, 1866, a large number of these Crows came
every evening to roost in an alder-grove near the town of Santa Cruz. They
<!--281.png--><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 251]</span>
gathered in long, continuous flocks from the neighboring fields, flying rather
high. All at once they would descend, with zigzag turns, to the low trees,
sportively chasing and pecking at one another, and chattering in the air.</p>

<p>Mr. John K. Lord, who enjoyed an unusually good opportunity of comparing
the habits of our common Crow with those of this species, has not the
slightest doubt as to their distinctness, though so very like in all essential
respects, as far as color, form of bill, and other details are concerned. The
smaller size of this bird, the difference in voice, and their habit of building
with mud a domed nest, sufficiently demonstrate their difference. This
Crow he found principally near the sea-coast; retiring to the trees at high
tide, following out its ebb and retreating before its flood, they feed on any
marine food they can find. The caw of this species reminded him of the
Jackdaws of Europe. During the breeding-season they abandoned the coast,
from early May resorting by pairs to the interior. Selecting patches of open
prairie, they build their nests in the bushes of the crab-apple or wild thorn,
and something in the manner of the Magpie, arching over the top with
sticks, with two openings for entrance and exit on either side. The inside
is plastered with mud, and lined with a few loose grass-stalks. The eggs he
found generally small, and of a lighter color than those of the common Crow.
After nesting, they return with their young to the sea-coast, and remain in
large flocks. During the breeding-season they feed on small reptiles, freshwater
mollusks, insects, grubs, etc. Mr. Lord noticed them capturing butterflies
flying near their nests. Their eggs range in number from five to seven.</p>

<p>An egg of this species from Sitka measures 1.62 inches in length by 1.12
in breadth. It is of an oblong-oval shape, pointed at one end. The ground-color
is a light sea-green, with marks and blotches of olive-brown, of varying
size and different shades.</p>

about 11 inches instead of 13); the bill is broader at the base and tapers more
rapidly to the end; the middle toe and claw are longer than the scutellate
portion of the tarsus, not shorter, the inner claw not reaching to the base of
the middle one. The tail is less rounded. The gloss on the belly is green
instead of violet; that on the back is mixed with green, not entirely violet.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Fish Crow of Eastern North America has a distribution
restricted to the Southern Atlantic and the Gulf shore. It is found in the
States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, the Carolinas,
Georgia, and Florida, and, according to Audubon, thence to the mouth
of the Mississippi. West of that river it appears to be very rarely met with.
Dr. Würdemann obtained it at Calcasieu, <abbr title="Louisiana">La.</abbr> Mr. Allen, in a list of the
birds of Massachusetts, published in 1864, names this species as an occasional
visitor along the southern coast of that State, but I am not able to
find any corroboration of the statement, and believe it to be a mistake. Dr.
De Kay, in his Report on the birds of New York, states that this Crow is
occasionally seen on the shores of Long Island, but Mr. Lawrence is confident
that it never occurs farther north than Squaw Beach, in New Jersey.
So, too, Mr. Townsend is quoted by both Audubon and Nuttall as authority
for its occurrence on the Columbia River, of which we have no confirmation.</p>

<p>This species was first described by Wilson, who met with it and observed
its habits on the sea-coast of Georgia. In some respects its habits were
the exact reverse of those of the common Crow, as the former regularly retired
at evening into the interior to roost, and came down to the shores of
the river Savannah, on the first appearance of day, to feed. Its voice first
attracted his notice; there was something in it very different from the utterances
of the Crow, being more hoarse and guttural, and more varied in its
modulations. The mode of flight was also observed to be quite different,
as the Fish Crow occasionally soars about in the manner of the Raven and
of Hawks, without flapping its wings,&mdash;a flight which the Crow is never
observed to make, and is probably not able to execute.</p>

<p>The food was also observed to be unlike, as well as the manner of procuring
it. The favorite haunt of this species seemed to be the banks of the
river, up and down which they soared, and in a very dexterous manner
snatched up with their claws dead fish, or other garbage found floating
on the surface. This Crow was also seen to perch frequently on the back of
cattle, in the manner of the Jackdaw of Europe. It was never seen to
mingle with the common Crows; and never, like the latter, roosts among the
reeds and marshes near the water, but always seeks the shelter of the woods,
in which to pass the night.</p>

<p>Afterwards, in his journey near the Mississippi, Wilson observed the same
birds frequenting the borders of rivers and ponds, and feeding on the reptiles
found in those waters. They were close attendants upon the cow-yards,
and were more solitary, but much less shy and suspicious, than the common
Crow. This species was also observed by Wilson in Cape May County, New
<!--283.png--><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 253]</span>
Jersey, and in the regions bordering on the Schuylkill and the Delaware, near
Philadelphia, during the shad and herring fishing, or from March till June.</p>

<p>During the breeding-season they were observed to separate into pairs, and
to build their nests in tall trees near the sea or the river shore. One of their
nests was in a tall wood at Great Egg Harbor, and they were presumed to
have four or five young at a time.</p>

<p>In the District of Columbia, Dr. Coues found the Fish Crow to be an
abundant resident throughout the year, less wary and suspicious than the
common Crow, and more confined to the borders of rivers. It was generally
confounded with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. americanus</i>.</p>

<p>The Fish Crow appears to have received, even if it does not merit, an
exemption from the general unpopularity of its race. It is generally believed
to be at least a harmless species, and in its destruction of reptiles and vermin
to be even beneficial. This belief, we apprehend, is for the most part
well founded. Yet Mr. Audubon accuses these Crows of entering gardens
and feeding upon the best fruits. He also states that, near Charleston, they
commit such depredations upon the ripe figs, and become so troublesome
generally in the gardens, that it is often found necessary to station a man
near the fig-trees to shoot and destroy them.</p>

<p>The Fish Crow is confined either to the maritime districts or to the banks
of rivers branching from them. Audubon states that they ascend the Delaware
to quite a distance, and that some breed in New Jersey every year, but
that all retire to the South on the approach of cold weather. Some go up
the Mississippi to the distance of five hundred miles, but return to the seashore
in the winter. In East Florida, where they were very abundant, Mr.
Audubon found them breeding in February, in South Carolina on the 20th
of March, and in New Jersey a month later. On the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s River, during
February, he saw them in flocks of several hundred, but all seemed
mated and to move in pairs, sailing high in the air in the manner of Ravens.
After these aerial excursions the whole body descended to the water’s edge to
feed. When their fishing was over, they would alight in flocks on the live-oaks
near the shore, and there keep up their gabbling, while they plumed
themselves, for hours. They then returned to their fishing-grounds, where they
remained until near sunset, moving into the interior to great distances, to roost
on the loblolly-pines. These retreats were made in silence, but their return
to the sea-shore in the early morning was made with noisy and lively demonstrations.
They were then to be seen among the bays, rivers, salt ponds, and
marshes, searching for small fry, and picking up any garbage they might find.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon also accuses them of robbing other birds of their eggs and
young. This was especially observed on the Florida Keys, where they even
dared to plunder the nests of the Cormorants and White Ibis. They feed
largely on the small crabs called fiddlers, which they pursue and easily capture
in their burrows. He has also seen them attack and pursue small Gulls
and Terns, and attempt to make them disgorge the fish they have caught; but
<!--284.png--><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 254]</span>
as the flight of the latter is swifter, they are frequently unsuccessful in these
attempts at robbery. This Crow can catch living fish with considerable
dexterity, but cannot feed while on the wing.</p>

<p>During the winter and early spring, Mr. Audubon states that these birds
feed on various kinds of berries, especially those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ilex cassina</i> and of
the common holly, and those of the exotic tallow-tree, now so common near
Charleston (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stillingia sebifera</i>). In January and February these trees are
much resorted to by the Crows, who greedily devour their white and oily seeds.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon found these birds breeding generally on moderate-sized trees
of the loblolly-pine, building their nests towards the extremities of the
branches, about twenty feet from the ground. The nests are smaller than
those of the Crow, and are built of sticks, lined with dry grasses and moss,
and neatly finished with fine fibrous roots. The eggs are five or six in number,
and resemble those of the Crow, but are smaller.</p>

<p>Two eggs of this species, from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Simon’s Island, measure, one 1.50
in length by 1.10 in breadth, the other 1.52 by 1.09. Their ground-color is
a light blue with a slight greenish tinge, marked over the entire egg with
small blotches of a light brown. An egg from Great Egg Harbor, obtained
by Wilson, from the old Peale Museum, and which may be a faded specimen,
has no tinge of blue or green, but a ground of pinkish-gray, marked with
smaller blotches and cloudings of dark drab. It measures 1.46 inches in
length by one inch in breadth.</p>

<p>This genus is so similar to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nucifraga</i> as to be hardly separable; the
principal difference being in the slender and more decurved and attenuated
bill, with a slightly concave, instead of convex, culmen, and plain instead

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
From Rocky Mountains to Pacific. East to Fort Kearney, north to Sitka,
south to Arizona.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Clarke’s Crow was first met with by the parties composing the
celebrated exploring party to the Rocky Mountains under the direction of
Lewis and Clarke. It was described by Wilson in 1811, who was informed
by individuals belonging to the expedition that these birds were
found inhabiting the shores of the Columbia and the adjacent country in
great numbers, frequenting the rivers and sea-shore, and that it seemed to
have all the noisy and gregarious habits of the common Crow of Europe.</p>

<p>In his account of this species, Mr. Nuttall states that during his journey
westward in the month of July, he first observed individuals of this bird in
a small grove of pines on the borders of Bear River, near where it falls into
Lake Timpanagos. This was at a height of about seven thousand feet
above the sea level, and in the <abbr title="forty-second">42d</abbr> parallel. Their habits appeared to him
to correspond with those of the Nutcrackers of Europe.</p>

<p>He afterwards saw a considerable flock of the young birds early in August,
in a lofty ravine near the Three Buttes, a remarkable isolated mountain
group about forty miles west of the Lewis River. They appeared somewhat
shy, and were scattered through a grove of aspens, flying, with a slight
chatter, from the tops of bushes and trees, to the ground. He was of the
opinion that this species never descends below the mountain plains, but that
it has a constant predilection for the pine forests.</p>

<p>Mr. Townsend afterwards found this species abundant on the Blue Mountains
of Oregon. He describes its flight as very unlike that of a Crow,
being performed in jerks, in the manner of a Woodpecker. At times, when
sitting, it is said to keep up a constant scream, in a very harsh and grating
voice, and in an unvaried and prolonged tone. He states that it breeds in
very high pine-trees, and that he did not meet with it within five hundred
miles of the Columbia River.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway found this species one of the most abundant birds of the
pine forests of the Sierra Nevada. East of this range it was also met with,
though only in smaller numbers, in the cedar and piñon woods of the East
Humboldt Mountains. He adds that it is a bird so curiously striking as
at once to attract attention. It bears but very little resemblance to any
bird of its family, and in its general appearance, flight, and notes approaches
<!--287.png--><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 257]</span>
so nearly to the Woodpeckers as to be usually known to the settlers as a
bird of that tribe.</p>

<p>He further remarks that its flight much resembles that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melanerpes torquatus</i>,
and, as it alights from the top of a tall dead tree, and sits quietly
gazing around, it might readily be mistaken for one of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picidæ</i>. He
describes them as being very active in their movements, now flying from a
tree to the ground to pick up some article of food, now examining the excavations
of an old dead stump or snag, or, on being approached, as flying up
and alighting upon the extreme summit of a tree, out of gunshot. It is a
very noisy bird, and its notes are harsh and discordant, though less so than
are those of the Steller’s Jay, which is generally seen in the same localities.
Its usual note is a harsh guttural <i class="birdcall">churr-churr</i>, generally uttered when two or
more alight on the same tree. Occasionally an individual takes up a peculiar
piping strain, which is immediately answered by all the others in the
neighborhood, thus awakening the echoes of the surrounding solitude with
their discordant cries. In regard to its nest he can give no positive information,
but thinks that they breed in cavities in old dead trees and stumps,
having found a nest in such a situation in the East Humboldt Mountains,
which he thinks belonged to a pair of these birds which were flying about,
and seen to enter this cavity.</p>

<p>Dr. Newberry, in his Report on the zoölogy of his route, states that he
found this species rather common along a large portion of it, and was thus
enabled to study its habits at leisure. He found it strictly confined to the
highlands and mountains, never, where he saw it, descending to a lower
altitude than about four thousand feet. On the other hand, while crossing
the Cascade Mountains at the line of perpetual snow, seven thousand feet
above the sea-level, he has seen this bird, in company with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melanerpes
torquatus</i>, flying over the snow-covered peaks three thousand feet above
him.</p>

<p>He first met with this bird on the spur of the Sierra Nevada, near Lassen’s
Butte, and found it constantly, when in high and timbered regions,
from there to the Columbia. He describes its habits as a compound, in
about equal parts of those of the Jays and of the Woodpeckers. Its cry
he speaks of as particularly harsh and disagreeable, something like that of
Steller’s Jay, but louder and more discordant. It seems to combine the
shrewdness with all the curiosity of the Jays and Crows, and from its
shyness is a very difficult bird to shoot, the Doctor never being able to
get directly within killing distance of one of them, but only obtaining
specimens by concealing himself and waiting for them to approach him.
Apparently from excess of caution, it almost invariably alights on a dry
tree. Even when going to a living tree for its food, it always flies first into
a dry one, if one is near, to reconnoitre, and, if the coast is clear, it begins
to feed. At the first movement of an intruder, without uttering a note, it
puts a safe distance between itself and its enemy.</p>

<p><!--288.png--><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 258]</span>
The food of this bird, at the time when Dr. Newberry visited its haunts,
consisted exclusively of the seeds of the yellow pine (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. ponderosa</i>), in dislodging
which from the cones the bird displays great dexterity. Both
Maximilian’s Jay and Steller’s Jay were, at that time, feeding on the same
seeds, but not so exclusively.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley obtained a specimen of this bird as far east as Milk River, in
Nebraska, about two hundred miles east of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>In crossing the Cascade Mountains, in 1853, Dr. Cooper found these birds
quite abundant on the banks of the Yakima River, and from thence north
wherever there were trees of the long-leaved pine, the seeds of which were
its principal food. On returning to Vancouver during the severe cold weather
of the following January, these birds appeared there in considerable numbers.
At no other season of the year has he met with them west of the
Cascade Mountains, and believes these migrations westward are only made
in the severest weather. They extend eastward throughout Washington Territory,
as Dr. Cooper has shot them at Fort Laramie, and met with a straggling
pair even as far east as Fort Kearney. Dr. Cooper has never known
these birds to eat anything except seeds and berries. They rarely descend to
the ground, and never frequent river-banks, or other places, for fish or carrion.
They may be seen on the tops of trees extracting seeds from cones,
hanging head downwards, like a Chickadee. Dr. Cooper has observed this
bird pecking at dead bark, in quest of insects. When feeding they are very
shy, flying off, if approached, to a great distance before alighting. They are
not known to visit the Coast Mountains south of San Francisco, but abound
in the Rocky Mountains throughout our limits.</p>

<p>Mr. J. K. Lord notes the arrival of this species at Fort Colville, in May,
in large flocks. They were hopping busily from branch to branch, amidst
pine-trees.</p>

<p>The statement made to Wilson that this species frequents rivers and seashores,
and his inference that its formidable claws indicated that they feed
on living animals, is controverted by Mr. Lord. They never frequent river-banks,
never by any chance eat fish, and never capture any living thing.
Their habits are strictly arboreal, and their food the seeds of pine-trees.
These noisy seed-hunters use their formidable claws to enable them to hang
on to the pine cones while they are extracting the seed, which they are
obliged to get out from under scaly coverings. For this nature has given
them feet and claws that serve the purpose of hands, and a powerful bill, like
a small crowbar. The cone must be steadied when they pry it open, or it
would snap and fall. One foot clasps it, and the powerful claws hold it
firmly. The other foot, encircling a branch, supports the bird in every possible
position, the long grasping claws being equal to any emergency. The
cone is thus fixed, and the seeds are forced out from under the scales. Mr.
Lord collected a large packet of seeds of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abies douglassi</i> from the crops
of these birds.</p>

<p><!--289.png--><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 259]</span>
On their arrival they assemble in immense flocks, and the noise they
make he describes as a most discordant, continuous, grating clatter, intensified
at times into a perfect shriek. These assemblies last about a week, after
which they separate in pairs.</p>

<p>A nest of this bird was found by Mr. Lord in the top of a lofty pine at least
two hundred feet high,&mdash;felled in cutting the boundary line. By chance
he discovered the nest, about which the old birds were hovering, leaving no
doubt of its identity. This nest was very large and composed of fir twigs,
bits of bark, the leaves of the pine, fine root-fibres, with small pieces of
moss, and gray lichens mixed carelessly with the other materials. It was
shallow and round, and presented a large extent of surface beyond the margins
of the hollow containing the eggs. The eggs were in fragments, much
like the eggs of Steller’s Jay in color, but of a lighter shade of bluish-green.
He thinks that their habit is to build in the very tallest pines.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly also met with this Crow west of Albuquerque, in New
Mexico, in the thick pine woods skirting the eastern slope of the Rocky
Mountains, where it was quite abundant. He rarely saw more than two or
three together. None were met with after leaving the mountains.</p>

<p>A single specimen of this crow was obtained at Sitka, by Bischoff.</p>

Wings considerably longer than the tail, and reaching to within an inch of
its tip. Tail nearly even. General
color dull blue, paler on the abdomen,
the middle of which is tinged with
ash; the head and neck of a much
deeper and more intense blue, darker
on the crown. Chin and forepart of
the throat whitish, streaked with blue.
Length, 10.00; wing, 5.90; tail, 4.50;
tarsus, 1.50. Young bird not differing
in markings.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Rocky Mountains of Colorado,
to Cascade <abbr title="Mountains">Mts.</abbr> of California and
Oregon. Not on the Pacific coast?
South to New Mexico and Arizona.</p>

<p>The female is appreciably different
from the male, both in size
and plumage, being smaller, and
of a light bluish-ash tint. This
difference is readily appreciable when the birds are seen flying.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Maximilian’s Jay was discovered and first described by that
eminent naturalist, Maximilian, Prince of Wied, in his book of travels in
North America, published in 1841. Mr. Edward Kern, who was connected
with Colonel Fremont’s exploring expedition in 1846, was the first to bring
specimens of this interesting and remarkable bird to the notice of American
naturalists, transmitting them to the Philadelphia Academy. The specimens
procured by its discoverer were met with by him on Maria’s River,
one of the tributaries of the Upper Missouri, in the extreme northern
portion of our northwestern territory, a point much farther north than it
has been met with by any other naturalist. As this species has since been
seen in large numbers in New Mexico, it may be presumed to extend its
movements over quite an extended area of distribution in the region of the
Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p><!--291.png--><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 261]</span>
According to the more recent observations of Mr. Ridgway, the Maximilian
Jay inhabits exclusively the nut-pine and cedar woods on the interior
mountain ranges, and is one of the most characteristic birds of those regions.
This species he states to be eminently gregarious, even breeding in colonies,
and in winter congregating in flocks, sometimes of thousands. Ever restless
and in motion, as it moves it is constantly uttering its curious, querulous
notes. It is a very conspicuous bird, and is one well worthy of particular
attention. Its blue color is the only thing suggestive of its affinity to the
Jay. All its habits are different, and its appearance is quite peculiar. It
is as essentially migratory as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ectopistes migratoria</i>, its coming and its
going being quite as sudden and uncertain. On one occasion, in visiting a
nut-pine wood, Mr. Ridgway found it full of roving, noisy troops of these
birds, but upon visiting the same locality the next day not one could be
seen.</p>

<p>He also states that these birds are exceedingly early in their nesting, as
he met with companies of fully fledged young flying about on the 21st
of April. Near Carson City, April 20, 1868, he found these birds abundant
among the scattered cedars and nut-pines on the lower slopes of the hills.
They were in pairs, often three or four pairs in company.</p>

<p>The notes of this bird are both peculiar and curious. The usual ones are
said to have some resemblance to the querulous wailings of the Screech
Owl; but none, in his opinion, have any resemblance to the cry of the Catbird.</p>

<p>It flies very swiftly, but with a gentle floating motion, very much in the
manner of the Robin. In its movements among the small cedars, it generally
alighted upon the summit of a tree, and, quietly sitting there, would
look about in the manner of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picicorvus columbianus</i>. In flying, it continually
uttered a very peculiar querulous note, resembling very much one
of the notes of the Magpie,&mdash;the peculiarly soft note of that bird uttered
during the love-season, or when its nest is approached. In searching among
the cedars, Mr. Ridgway found several of its nests. Nearly all had been
deserted, and there were several families of fully fledged young flying about.
One nest contained four fully feathered young. When these had been taken,
and placed in a hat, they all jumped out, squalling vociferously. These
nests were all saddled upon horizontal branches of cedars, and, except in
their greater bulk, they closely resembled the nest of the eastern Blue Jay.</p>

<p>In autumn and in winter the large flocks of these birds, as they fly back
and forth over the hills, present a very peculiar appearance. Their flight is
then very swift.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly, in November, 1853, frequently saw large flocks of these
birds between the Puebla of Laguna and the Sierra Madre, about a hundred
miles west of Albuquerque, in New Mexico. They were found chiefly frequenting
the watercourses, and when startled would circle around, rising
higher above their heads, uttering their singular cries; then suddenly descending
<!--292.png--><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 262]</span>
they would alight in the top of some tree on the adjoining cliffs.
He compares its voice to that of the common Catbird.</p>

<p>Dr. T. C. Henry also repeatedly noticed these birds in the vicinity of Fort
Webster, in New Mexico. He first met with them near San Miguel, in
July, 1852, where he observed a party of about thirty flitting through the
cedars along the roadside. They were chiefly young birds, and were constantly
alighting on the ground for the purpose of capturing lizards, which
they killed with great readiness, and devoured. After that he repeatedly,
in winter, saw these birds near Fort Webster, and usually in flocks of about
forty or fifty. They evinced great wariness, and were very difficult of approach.</p>

<p>The flocks would usually alight near the summit of a hill and pass rapidly
down its sides, all the birds keeping quite near to each other, and frequently
alighting on the ground. They appeared to be very social, and kept
up a continual twittering note. This bird, so far as Dr. Henry observed it,
is exclusively a mountain species, and never seen on the plains or bottom-lands,
and was never observed singly, or even in a single pair, but always in
companies.</p>

<p>Dr. Newberry met with this species in the basin of the Des Chutes, in
Oregon. He first noticed it in September. Early every morning flocks of
from twenty-five to thirty of these birds came across, in their usual straggling
flight, chattering as they flew to the trees on a hill near the camp, and then,
from tree to tree, they made their way to the stream to drink. He describes
their note, when flying or feeding, as a frequently repeated <i class="birdcall">ca-ca-că</i>. Sometimes,
when made by a straggler separated from mate or flock, it was rather
loud and harsh, but was usually soft and agreeable. When disturbed, their
cry was harsher. They were very shy, and could only be shot by lying in
wait for them. Subsequently he had an opportunity of seeing them feed,
and of watching them carefully as they were eating the berries of the cedars,
and in their habits and cries they seemed closely to resemble Jays. A specimen,
previously killed, was found with its crop filled with the seeds of the
yellow pine.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper has seen specimens of this bird from Washoe, just east of
the California State line, and he was informed by Mr. Clarence King that
they frequent the junipers on mountains near Mariposa.</p>

<p>From Dr. Coues we learn that this bird is very abundant at Fort Whipple,
where it remains all the year. It breeds in the retired portions of the
neighboring mountains of San Francisco and Bill Williams, the young leaving
the nest in July. As the same birds are ready to fly in April, at Carson
City, it may be that they have two broods in Arizona. During the winter
they collect in immense flocks, and in one instance Dr. Coues estimates
their number at a thousand or more. In a more recent contribution to the
Ibis (April, 1872), Dr. Coues gives a more full account of his observations
in respect to this bird. In regard to geographical range he considers its
<!--293.png--><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 263]</span>
distribution very nearly the same with that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picicorvus</i>. Mr. Aiken
has recently met with these birds in Colorado Territory, where, however,
Mr. Allen did not obtain specimens. General McCall found these birds
abundant near Santa Fé, in New Mexico, at an altitude Of seven thousand
feet; and the late Captain Feilner obtained specimens at Fort Crook, in
Northeastern California. Dr. Coues considers its range to be the coniferous
zone of vegetation within the geographical area bounded eastward
by the foot-hills and slopes of the Rocky Mountains; westward by the
Cascade and Coast ranges; northward, perhaps to Sitka, but undetermined;
and somewhat so southward, not traced so far as the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tierra fria</i>
of Mexico.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues adds that, like most birds which subsist indifferently on varied
animal or vegetable food, this species is not, strictly speaking, migratory,
as it can find food in winter anywhere except at its loftiest points of
distribution. A descent of a few thousand feet from the mountains thus
answers all the purposes of a southward journey performed by other species,
so far as food is concerned, while its hardy nature enables it to endure the
rigors of winter. According to his observations, this bird feeds principally
upon juniper berries and pine seeds, and also upon acorns and other small
hard fruits.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues describes this bird as garrulous and vociferous, with curiously
modulated chattering notes when at ease, and with extremely loud harsh
cries when excited by fear or anger. It is also said to be restless and
impetuous, as if of an unbalanced mind. Its attitudes on the ground, to
which it frequently descends, are essentially Crow-like, and its gait is an
easy walk or run, very different from the leaping manner of progress
made by the Jays. When perching, its usual attitude is stiff and firm.
Its flight resembles that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picicorvus</i>. After breeding, these birds
unite in immense flocks, but disperse again in pairs when the breeding-season
commences.</p>

<p>Nothing, so far, has been published in regard to the character of the
eggs.</p>

<p>There is a very close relationship between the Jays and the Titmice, the
chief difference being in size rather than in any other distinguishing feature.
The feathers at the base of the bill, however, in the Jays, are bristly throughout,
with lateral branches reaching to the very tip. In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paridæ</i> these feathers
are inclined to be broader, with the shaft projecting considerably beyond the
basal portion, or the lateral branches are confined to the basal portion, and
extended forwards. There is no naked line of separation between the
scutellæ on the outer side of the tarsi. The basal joint of the middle toe
is united almost or quite to the end to the lateral, instead of half-way.
The first primary is usually less than half the second, instead of rather
more; the fourth and fifth primaries nearly equal and longest, instead of the
fifth being longer than the fourth.</p>

Richardson observed these birds on the Saskatchewan, where a few remain
even in winter, but are much more frequent in summer.</p>

<p>Mr. Lord, the naturalist of the British branch of the Northwest Boundary
Survey, characterizes our Magpie as murderous, because of its cruel persecution
of galled and suffering mules, its picking out the eyes of living animals,
and its destruction of birds. These birds caused so much trouble to the
party, in winter, at Colville, as to become utterly unbearable, and a large
number were destroyed by strychnine. They were then so tame and
impudent that he repeatedly gave them food from his hand without their
showing any evidence of fear. He says they nest in March.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley states that this Magpie is abundant throughout the central
region of Oregon and Washington Territory. He first met with it a hundred
miles west of Fort Union, at the mouth of the Yellowstone. It became
more abundant as the mountains were approached, and so continued almost
as far west as the Cascade Mountains, where the dense forests were an
effectual barrier. On Puget Sound he saw none until August, after which,
during the fall, it was tolerably abundant. It breeds throughout the interior.
He obtained a young bird, nearly fledged, about May 5, at Fort
Dalles. At this place a few birds remain throughout the winter, but a
majority retire farther south during the cold weather. One of its cries, he
says, resembles a peculiar call of Steller’s Jay.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway regards this Magpie as one of the most characteristic and
conspicuous birds of the interior region, distinguished both for the elegance
of its form and the beauty of its plumage. While not at all rare in the
fertile mountain cañons, the principal resort of this species is the rich bottom-land
of the rivers. The usual note of the Magpie is a frequently uttered
chatter, very peculiar, and, when once heard, easily recognized. During the
nesting-season it utters a softer and more musical and plaintive note, sounding
something like <i class="birdcall">kay´-e-ehk-kay-e</i>. It generally flies about in small flocks,
and, like others of its family, is very fond of tormenting owls. In the winter,
in company with the Ravens, it resorts to the slaughter-houses to feed on offal.
The young differ but little in plumage from the adult, the metallic colors
being even a little more vivid; the white spotting of the throat is characteristic
of the immature bird.</p>

<p>The nests were found by Mr. Ridgway in various situations. Some were
in cedars, some in willows, and others in low shrubs. In every instance the
nest was domed, the inner and real nest being enclosed in an immense thorny
covering, which far exceeded it in bulk. In the side of this thorny protection
is a winding passage leading into the nest, possibly designed to conceal the
very long tail of the bird, which, if exposed to view, would endanger its safety.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper first met this bird east of the Cascade Mountains, near the
Yakima, and from there in his journey northward as far as the 49th degree
it was common, as well as in all the open unwooded regions until the
mountains were passed on his return westward.</p>

<p><!--300.png--><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 268]</span>
Dr. Kennerly met with these birds on the Little Colorado in New Mexico,
in December. He found them in great numbers soon after leaving the
Rio Grande, and from time to time on the march to California. They seemed
to live indifferently in the deep cañons among the hills or in the valleys,
but were only found near water.</p>

<p>Dr. Newberry first met with these birds on the banks of one of the
tributaries of the Des Chutes, one hundred miles south of the Columbia,
afterwards on the Columbia, but nowhere in large numbers. He regards
them as much less gregarious in their habits than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pica nuttalli</i>, as all the
birds he noticed were solitary or in pairs, while the Yellow-bills were often
seen in flocks of several hundreds.</p>

<p>All accounts of this bird agree in representing it as frequently a great
source of annoyance to parties of exploration, especially in its attacks
upon horses worn down and galled by fatigue and privations. In the memorable
narrative of Colonel Pike’s journey in New Mexico, these birds, rendered
bold and voracious by want, are described as assembling around that
miserable party in great numbers, picking the sore backs of their perishing
horses, and snatching at all the food they could reach. The party of Lewis
and Clark, who were the first to add this bird to our fauna, also describe them
as familiar and voracious, penetrating into their tents, snatching the meat
even from their dishes, and frequently, when the hunters were engaged in
dressing their game, seizing the meat suspended within a foot or two of
their heads.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall, in his tour across the continent, found these birds so familiar
and greedy as to be easily taken, as they approached the encampment for
food, by the Indian boys, who kept them prisoners. They soon became
reconciled to their confinement, and were continually hopping around and
tugging and struggling for any offal thrown to them.</p>

<p>Observers have reported this bird from different parts of Arizona and New
Mexico; but Dr. Coues writes me that he never saw it at Fort Whipple, or
elsewhere in the first-named Territory. He found it breeding, however, in
the Raton Mountains, in June, under the following circumstances, recorded
at the time in his journal.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Yesterday, the 8th, we were rolling over smooth prairie, ascending a
little the while, but so gradually that only the change in the flora indicated
the difference in elevation. The flowery verdure was passed, scrubby junipers
came thicker and faster, and pine-clad mountain-tops took shape before us.
We made the pass to-day, rounding along a picturesque ravine, and the
noon halt gave me a chance to see something of the birds. Troops of
beautiful Swallows were on wing, and as their backs turned in their wayward
flight, the violet-green colors betrayed the species. A colony of them
were breeding on the face of a cliff, apparently like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. lunifrons</i>, but the
nests were not accessible. Whilst I was watching their movements, a harsh
scream attracted my attention, and the next moment a beautiful Magpie
<!--301.png--><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 269]</span>
flew swiftly past with quivering wings, and with a flirt of the glittering tail
and a curious evolution dashed into a dense thicket close by. In the hope
of seeing him again, and perhaps of finding his nest, I hurried to the spot
where he had disappeared, and pushed into the underbrush. In a few
moments I stood in a little open space, surrounded on all sides and covered
above with a network of vines interlacing the twigs and foliage so closely
that the sun’s rays hardly struggled through. A pretty shady bower! and
there, sure enough, was the nest, not likely to be overlooked, for it was as
big as a bushel basket,&mdash;a globular mass, hung in the top of one of the
taller saplings, about twelve feet from the ground. The mother bird was at
home, and my bustling approach alarmed her; she flew out of the nest with
loud cries of distress, which brought the male to her side in an instant. As
I scrambled up the slender trunk, which swayed with my weight, both birds
kept flying about my head with redoubled outcry, alighting for an instant,
then dashing past again so close that I thought they would peck at me. As
I had no means of preserving the nest, I would not take it down, and contented
myself with such observations as I could make whilst bestriding a
limb altogether too slender for comfort. It was nearly spherical in shape,
seemed to be about eighteen inches in diameter, arched over, with a small
hole on one side. The walls, composed entirely of interlaced twigs bristling
outwardly in every direction, were extremely thick, the space inside being
much less than one would expect, and seemingly hardly enough to accommodate
the bird’s long tail, which I suppose must be held upright. The nest
was lined with a little coarse dried grass, and contained six young ones
nearly ready to fly. Authors state that the American Magpie lays only two
eggs; but I suppose that this particular pair lived too far from scientific
centres to find out what was expected of them. Other birds, noticed to-day,
were Steller’s Jays among the pines and cedars, a flock of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chrysomitris</i>,
apparently <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pinus</i>, feeding on willow-buds along the rivulet that threaded the
gorge, and some Robins.”</p>

<p>The eggs of this Magpie are somewhat larger than any I have seen of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. nuttalli</i>, and are differently marked and colored. Six specimens from
the Sierra Nevada exhibit the following measurements: 1.40 × 0.98, 1.22
× 1.00, 1.41 × 0.95, 1.28 × 0.95, 1.26 × 0.92, 1.32 × 0.96. Their ground-color
is a grayish-white, or light gray with a yellowish tinge, spotted with
blotches, dottings, and dashes of a purplish or violet brown. In some they
are sparsely distributed, showing plainly the ground, more confluent at the
larger end. In others they are finer, more generally and more thickly distributed.
In others they are much larger and of deeper color, and cover the
whole of the larger end with one large cloud of confluent markings. None
of these closely resembles the eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. nuttalli</i>. The usual number of eggs
in a nest, according to Mr. Ridgway, varies from six to nine, although it is
said that ten are sometimes found.</p>

California (Sacramento Valley, and southern coast region).</p>

<p>We cannot look upon the Yellow-billed Magpie otherwise than as a local
race of the common kind, since it is well known that among the Jays many
species have the bill either black or yellow according to sex, age, or locality;
and as the Yellow-billed Magpie occupies a more southern locality than
usual, and one very different from that of the black-billed species, it well
may exhibit a special geographical variation. The great restriction in range
is another argument in favor of its being a simple variety.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Yellow-billed Magpie seems to be exclusively a bird of
California, where it is very abundant, and where it replaces almost entirely
the more eastern form. Mr. Ridgway, who met with this variety only in
the valley of the Sacramento, states that he there found it very abundant
among the oaks of that region. It differed from the common Magpie in
being exceedingly gregarious, moving about among the oak groves in small
companies, incessantly chattering as it flew, or as it sat among the branches
of the trees. He saw many of their nests in the tops of the oaks,&mdash;indeed,
all were so situated,&mdash;yet he never met with the nests of the other species
in a high tree, not even in the river valleys. The young of this Magpie
have the white of the scapulars marked with rusty triangular spots.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found this Magpie abundant in the valleys of California, especially
near the middle of the State, except during the spring months, when
none were seen in the Santa Clara Valley, the supposition being that they
had retired eastward to the mountains to build their nests. At Santa Barbara
he found them numerous in April and May, and saw their nests in oak-trees.
The young were already fledged by the 25th of April. The nest, he
states, is composed of a large mass of coarse twigs twisted together in a
spherical form, with a hole in the side. The eggs he saw resembled those
of the other species, and are described as being whitish-green, spotted with
cinereous-gray and olive-brown. They also breed abundantly about Monterey.
They have not been traced to the northern border of the State.</p>

<p>Their food, Dr. Cooper adds, consists of almost everything animal and
vegetable that they can find, and they come about farms and gardens to pick
up whatever they can meet with. They have a loud call that sounds like
<!--303.png--><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 271]</span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pait-pait</i>, with a variety of chattering notes, in tone resembling the human
voice, which, indeed, they can be taught to imitate.</p>

<p>An egg of this species from Monterey, California, is of a rounded oval
shape, a little less obtuse at one end than the other. The ground-color is a
light drab, so closely marked with fine cloudings of an obscure lavender
color as nearly to conceal the ground, and to give the egg the appearance of
an almost uniform violet-brown. It measures 1.20 inches in length by .90
in breadth.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Blue
Jay of North America is found
throughout the continent, from
the Atlantic coast to the Missouri
Valley, and from Florida
and Texas to the fur regions
nearly or quite to the 56th
parallel. It was found breeding
near Lake Winnepeg by Donald
Gunn. It was also observed in
these regions by Sir John Richardson.
It was met with by
Captain Blakiston on the forks
of the Saskatchewan, but not
farther west.</p>

<p>The entire family to which
this Jay belongs, and of which
it is a very conspicuous member,
is nearly cosmopolitan as to distribution, and is distinguished by the
remarkable intelligence of all its members. Its habits are striking, peculiar,
and full of interest, often evincing sagacity, forethought, and intelligence
strongly akin to reason. These traits belong not exclusively to any one
species or generic subdivision, but are common to the whole family.</p>

<p>When first met with in the wild and unexplored regions of our country,
the Jay appears shy and suspicious of the intruder, man. Yet, curious to a
remarkable degree, he follows the stranger, watches all his movements, hovers
with great pertinacity about his steps, ever keeping at a respectful distance,
even before he has been taught to beware of the deadly gun. Afterwards,
as he becomes better acquainted with man, the Jay conforms his own
conduct to the treatment he receives. Where he is hunted in wanton sport,
because of brilliant plumage, or persecuted because of unjust prejudices and
a bad reputation not deserved, he is shy and wary, shuns, as much as possible,
human society, and, when the hunter intrudes into his retreat, seems to
delight to follow and annoy him, and to give the alarm to all dwellers of
the woods that their foe is approaching.</p>

<p>In parts of the country, as in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and other Western
States, where the Jay is unmolested and exempt from persecution, we find
him as familiar and confiding as any of the favored birds of the Eastern
States. In the groves of Iowa Mr. Allen found our Blue Jay nearly as
unsuspicious as a Black-capped Titmouse. In Illinois he speaks of them as
very abundant and half domestic. And again, in Indiana, in one of the
<!--307.png--><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 275]</span>
principal streets of Richmond, the same gentleman found the nest of these
birds in a lilac-bush, under the window of a dwelling. In the summer of
1843 I saw a nest of the Jay, filled with young, in a tree standing near the
house of Mr. Audubon, in the city of New York. The habits of no two
species can well be more unlike than are those which persecution on the
one hand and kind treatment on the other have developed in this bird.</p>

<p>The Blue Jay, wherever found, is more or less resident. This is especially
the case in the more southern portions of its area of reproduction. In
Texas, Dr. Lincecum informs us, this Jay remains both summer and winter.
It is there said to build its nest of mud, a material rarely if ever used in
more northern localities; and when placed not far from dwelling-houses,
it is lined with cotton thread, rags of calico, and the like. They are, he
writes, very intelligent and sensible birds, subsisting on insects, acorns,
etc. He has occasionally known them to destroy bats. In Texas they seem
to seek the protection of man, and to nest near dwellings as a means of
safety against Hawks. They nest but once a year, and lay but four eggs.
In a female dissected by him, he detected one hundred and twelve ova, and
from these data he infers that the natural life of a Jay is about thirty years.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen mentions finding the Blue Jay in Kansas equally at home,
and as vivacious and even more gayly colored than at the North. While
it seemed to have forgotten none of the droll notes and fantastic ways
always to be expected from it, there was added to its manners that familiarity
which characterizes it in the more newly settled portions of the
country, occasionally surprising one with some new expression of feeling
or sentiment, or some unexpected eccentricity in its varied notes, perhaps
developed by the more southern surroundings.</p>

<p>The Blue Jay is arboreal in its habits. It prefers the shelter and security
of thick covers to more open ground. It is omnivorous, eating either animal
or vegetable food, though with an apparent preference for the former,
feeding upon insects, their eggs and larvæ, and worms, wherever procurable.
It also lays up large stores of acorns and beech mast for food in winter,
when insects cannot be procured in sufficient abundance. Even at this season
it hunts for and devours in large quantities the eggs of the destructive
tent caterpillar.</p>

<p>The Jay is charged with a propensity to destroy the eggs and young of the
smaller birds, and has even been accused of killing full-grown birds. I am
not able to verify these charges, but they seem to be too generally conceded
to be disputed. These are the only serious grounds of complaint that can
be brought against it, and are more than outweighed, tenfold, by the immense
services it renders to man in the destruction of his enemies. Its depredations
on the garden or the farm are too trivial to be mentioned.</p>

<p>The Blue Jay is conspicuous as a musician. He exhibits a variety in his
notes, and occasionally a beauty and a harmony in his song, for which few
give him due credit. Wilson compares his position among our singing birds
<!--308.png--><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 276]</span>
to that of the trumpeter in the band. His notes he varies to an almost
infinite extent, at one time screaming with all his might, at another warbling
with all the softness of tone and moderation of the Bluebird, and
again imparting to his voice a grating harshness that is indescribable.</p>

<p>The power of mimicry possessed by the Jay, though different from, is
hardly surpassed by that of the Mocking-Bird. It especially delights to
imitate the cries of the Sparrow Hawk, and at other times those of the Red-tailed
and Red-shouldered Hawks are given with such similarity that the
small birds fly to a covert, and the inmates of the poultry-yard are in the
greatest alarm. Dr. Jared P. Kirtland, of Cleveland, on whose grounds a
large colony of Jays took up their abode and became very familiar, has given
me a very interesting account of their habits. The following is an extract:
“They soon became so familiar as to feed about our yards and corn-cribs.
At the dawn of every pleasant day throughout the year, the nesting-season
excepted, a stranger in my house might well suppose that all the axles in
the country were screeching aloud for lubrication, hearing the harsh and discordant
utterances of these birds. During the day the poultry might be
frequently seen running into their hiding-places, and the gobbler with his
upturned eye searching the heavens for the enemy, all excited and alarmed
by the mimic utterances of the adapt ventriloquists, the Jays, simulating the
cries of the Red-shouldered and the Red-tailed Hawks. The domestic circle
of the barn-yard evidently never gained any insight into the deception by experience;
for, though the trick was repeated every few hours, the excitement
would always be re-enacted.”</p>

<p>When reared from the nest, these birds become very tame, and are perfectly
reconciled to confinement. They very soon grow into amusing pets,
learning to imitate the human voice, and to simulate almost every sound that
they hear. Wilson gives an account of one that had been brought up in a
family of a gentleman in South Carolina that displayed great intelligence,
and had all the loquacity of a parrot. This bird could utter several words
with great distinctness, and, whenever called, would immediately answer to
its name with great sociability.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Esteep, of Canton, Ohio, an experienced bird-fancier, assured
Dr. Kirtland that he has invariably found the Blue Jay more ingenious,
cunning, and teachable than any other species of bird he has ever attempted
to instruct.</p>

<p>Dr. Kirtland has also informed me of the almost invaluable services rendered
to the farmers in his neighborhood, by the Blue Jays, in the destruction
of caterpillars. When he first settled on his farm, he found every apple
and wild-cherry tree in the vicinity extensively disfigured and denuded of
its leaves by the larvæ of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Clisiocampa americana</i>, or the tent caterpillar.
The evil was so extensive that even the best farmers despaired of counteracting
it. Not long after the Jays colonized upon his place he found they
were feeding their young quite extensively with these larvæ, and so
<!--309.png--><!--plate 39, above-->
<!--310.png--><!--blank page-->
<!--311.png--><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 277]</span>
thoroughly that two or three years afterwards not a worm was to be seen
in that neighborhood; and more recently he has searched for it in vain, in
order to rear cabinet specimens of the moth.</p>

<p>The Jay builds a strong coarse nest in the branch of some forest or orchard
tree, or even in a low bush. It is formed of twigs rudely but strongly
interwoven, and is lined with dark fibrous roots. The eggs are usually five,
and rarely six in number.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are usually of a rounded-oval shape, obtuse, and
of very equal size at either end. Their ground-color is a brownish-olive,
varying in depth, and occasionally an olive-drab. They are sparingly spotted
with darker olive-brown. In size they vary from 1.05 to 1.20 inches in
length, and in breadth from .82 to .88 of an inch. Their average size is
about 1.15 by .86 of an inch.</p>

Mary’s Mission, Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Dr. Suckley regarded Steller’s Jay as probably the most abundant
bird of its size in all the wooded country between the Rocky Mountains
and the Pacific. He describes it as tame, loquacious, and possessed of the
most impudent curiosity. It is a hardy, tough bird, and a constant winter
resident of Washington Territory. It is remarkable for its varied cries and
<!--312.png--><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 278]</span>
notes, and seems to have one for every emotion or pursuit in which it
is engaged. It also has a great fondness for imitating the notes of other
birds. Dr. Suckley states that frequently when pleasantly excited by the
hope of obtaining a rare bird, in consequence of hearing an unknown note
issuing from some clump of bushes or thicket, he has been not a little disappointed
by finding that it had issued from this Jay. It mimics accurately
the principal cry of the Catbird.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper also found it very common in all the forests on both sides of
the Cascade Mountains. While it seemed to depend chiefly upon the forest
for its food, in the winter it would make visits to the vicinity of houses, and
steal anything eatable it could find within its reach, even potatoes. In
these forages upon the gardens and farm-yards, they are both silent and
watchful, evidently conscious of the peril of their undertaking, and when
discovered they instantly fly off to the concealment of the forests. They
also make visits to the Indian lodges when the owners are absent, and force
their way into them if possible, one of their number keeping watch. In the
forest they do not appear to be shy or timid, but boldly follow those who
intrude upon their domain, screaming, and calling their companions around
them. Hazel-nuts are one of their great articles of winter food; and Dr.
Cooper states that, in order to break the shell, the Jay resorts to the ingenious
expedient of taking them to a branch of a tree, fixing them in a
crotch or cavity, and hammering them with its bill until it can reach the
meat within. Their nest he describes as large, loosely built of sticks, and
placed in a bush or low tree.</p>

<p>At certain seasons of the year its food consisted almost entirely of the
seeds of the pine, particularly of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. brachyptera</i>, which Dr. Newberry states he
has often seen them extracting from the cones, and with which the stomachs
of those he killed were usually filled. He found these birds ranging as far
north as the line of the British Territory, and from the coast to the Rocky
Mountains.</p>

<p>In his Western journey Mr. Nuttall met with these birds in the Blue Mountains
of the Oregon, east of Walla-walla. There he found them scarce and
shy. Afterwards he found them abundant in the pine forests of the Columbia,
where their loud trumpeting clangor was heard at all hours of the day, calling
out with a loud voice, <i class="birdcall">djay-djay</i>, or chattering with a variety of other notes,
some of them similar to those of the common Blue Jay. They are more
bold and familiar than our Jay. Watchful as a dog, no sooner does a
stranger show himself in their vicinity than they neglect all other employment
to come round him, following and sometimes scolding at him with great
pertinacity and signs of irritability. At other times, stimulated by curiosity,
they follow for a while in perfect silence, until something seems to arouse
their ire, and then their vociferous cries are poured out with unceasing volubility
till the intruder has passed from their view.</p>

<p>In the month of May, Mr. Nuttall found a nest of these birds in a small
<!--313.png--><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 279]</span>
sapling of the Douglas fir, on the borders of a dense forest, and, some time
after, a second nest with young, in an elevated branch of another fir, on the
border of a rocky cliff. The first nest contained four eggs, of a pale green,
marked with small olive-brown spots, varied with others inclining to a violet
hue. The parents flew at him with the utmost anger and agitation, almost
deafening him with their cries; and although he took only two of their eggs,
the next day he found they had forsaken their nest. This nest was bulky,
made of interlaced twigs and roots, with a stout layer of mud, and lined
with black rootlets. One of the eggs taken by Mr. Nuttall is in my cabinet,
and is as he describes it, except that the obscure markings of violet have
nearly faded out. It measures 1.20 inches in length, and .90 in breadth, is
oval in shape, and a little more obtuse at one end than at the other.</p>

<p>This Jay was obtained by Steller at Nootka, on the west coast of Vancouver
Island, in latitude 50<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. It was also found in abundance by Mr. Dall
at Sitka, in British Columbia, where a number of specimens were obtained
by Mr. Bischoff and by Mr. Elliot.</p>

<p>Mr. J. K. Lord states that this Jay ever makes its presence known by the
constant utterance of discordant screams. It is continually hopping from
bough to bough, darting down to catch an insect, performing short, erratic
flights, and jerking up and down its crest of bright feathers. Its noisy song
seems to be everywhere. It is the embodiment of restlessness, and, by dint
of sheer impudence, attracts attention even from the hunter. He adds that
it seemed fond of frequenting the haunts of man, and is always plentiful
near Indian lodges or white men’s shanties. It is by no means epicurean
in taste, but readily devours anything, whether seeds or salmon, grasshoppers
or venison. Its nest he found artfully concealed amidst the thick foliage
of a young pine-tree. It was composed of moss, small twigs, lichens,
and fir fronds, and lined with deer’s hair. The average number of eggs laid
appears to be seven.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Whole length of the Sierra Nevada, from Fort Crook (where it approaches
<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stelleri</i>) to Fort Tejon.</p>

<p>In the colors of the body, wings, and tail, this well-marked race resembles
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. macrolopha</i> in every respect, except that the greater coverts are not barred
with black; there being the same abrupt contrast between the deep blue of
the wings and tail, and the light greenish-blue of the body, tail-coverts, and
primaries,&mdash;seen only in these two forms. The variety is confined to the
mountains of California and Western Nevada, extending along the Sierra
Nevada about the entire length of the State, there being specimens in the
collection from Fort Crook and Fort Tejon, and intermediate localities.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Blue-fronted Jay, so far as it was observed by Mr. Ridgway,
was found to be exclusively an inhabitant of the pine woods of the Sierra
Nevada, and is, with Clarke’s Nutcracker, one of the most characteristic
birds of that region. In its general habits and manners, it greatly resembles
the eastern Blue Jay, but is rather more shy, while its notes are very
different, and do not possess the variety and flexibility of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cristata</i>, but
are in comparison harsh and discordant. The usual note is a hoarse, deep-toned
monosyllabic squawk. Sometimes it utters a hollow sonorous chatter.</p>

<p>Near Carson City one of these birds had been winged by a shot, and, in
falling, alighted on the lower branches of a pine-tree. Upon an attempt to
capture it, the bird began to ascend the tree limb by limb, at the same
time uttering a perfect imitation of the cry of the Red-tailed Hawk, evidently
in the hope of frightening away his tormentors. Dr. Newberry regards this
Jay as the western counterpart of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. cristata</i>. By its more conspicuous
crest, its bold, defiant air, and its excessively harsh and disagreeable cry, it
challenges and secures attention. He found it almost exclusively confined
to the hilly and mountainous districts, choosing in preference those covered
with pines.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann found these Jays abundant and resident as far south as
Warner’s Ranch, where, though common, they were for some reason so
unusually wild and vigilant as not to be easily procurable. In feeding, he
observed that they seemed always to begin in the lower branches and
ascend, hopping from twig to twig, to the topmost point, and, while thus
employed, utter a harsh screaming note that can be heard to a considerable
distance.</p>

<p>This species, Dr. Cooper states, is numerous in the mountains of California,
inhabiting the whole length of the Sierra Nevada, and the Coast
Range as far south, at least, as Santa Cruz. Though showing a decided preference
for the pine forests, they sometimes in winter frequent those of
oaks. They are omnivorous, eating seeds, acorns, nuts, insects, and in winter
even potatoes and dead fish. They are at times bold and prying, and at
others very cautious and suspicious. They soon learn to appreciate a gun,
<!--315.png--><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 281]</span>
and show great sagacity in their movements to avoid its peril. On the
Columbia they lay in May, and in California about a month earlier.</p>

Central line of Rocky Mountains from northern border of the United States to

<p>Young birds have the bright blue of body and black of head replaced by
a dull slate; the head unvaried.</p>

<p>An apparent link between this variety and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. stelleri</i> is represented in
the Smithsonian collection by three specimens from the region towards
the head-waters of the Columbia, where the respective areas of distribution
of the two overlap. In this the anterior parts of the body are nearly as
black as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stelleri</i> (much darker than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">macrolopha</i>), with the short crest; but
the forehead (except in one specimen) is streaked with blue, and there is a
white patch over the eye. As in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stelleri</i>, there are no black bars on the
greater wing-coverts. As this is an abundant form, whether permanent race
or hybrid, it may be called <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">annectens</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Long-crested Jay appears to occur throughout the central
range of the Rocky Mountains from British Columbia to Mexico, where it
is replaced by a closely allied species or race, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanura coronata</i> of Swainson.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway met with this Jay only among the Wahsatch and the
Uintah Mountains. They appeared to be rather common in those regions,
though far from being abundant. In their manners and in their notes
they are described as having been almost an exact counterpart of the
Sierra Nevada form. Their notes, however, are said to be not so loud nor
so coarse as those of the more western species. A nest, found by Mr. Ridgway,
June 25, 1869, in Parley’s Park, Wahsatch Mountains, was in a small
<!--316.png--><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 282]</span>
fir-tree on the edge of a wood. It was saddled on a horizontal branch
about fifteen feet from the ground, and contained six eggs. The base of the
nest was composed of coarse strong sticks, rudely put together. Upon this
was constructed a solid, firm plastering of mud of a uniform concave shape,
lined with fine wiry roots. The external diameter is about nine inches, and
the height of the nest four. The interior is five inches in diameter, and three
in depth.</p>

<p>The species was first described by Professor Baird, from specimens
obtained by Dr. Kennerly, who writes that he first saw this bird among
the lofty pines of the Sierra Madre in November, 1853. Leaving that
range, he did not meet with it again until his party crossed the Aztec
Mountains, in January, 1854, where it was less abundant than when first
met with. It was, for the most part, found among the cedars on the high
grounds, though occasionally seen among the clumps of large pines that
were scattered along the valley. The party did not meet with it again.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found this species a common and a resident bird in Arizona.
It was observed to be almost exclusively an inhabitant of pine woods, and was
generally to be met with only in small companies, never congregating in the
manner of Woodhouse’s Jay. He describes it as very shy, vigilant, noisy,
and tyrannical.</p>

<p>The eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. macrolopha</i> measure 1.30 inches in length and .91 in breadth.
Their ground-color is a light sea-green. They are somewhat sparingly
spotted with fine markings of dark olive-brown, and lighter cloudings of a
purplish or violet brown. They are oblong oval in shape, obtuse at either
end, but more tapering at one end. They appear to be a little larger than
the eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stelleri</i>, and the ground-color is brighter, and the markings deeper
and more of an olive hue.</p>

Head without crest. Wings and tail blue, without any bands. Back usually
with a gray patch, different from the head. Bill about as broad as high at the base, and
the culmen a little shorter than the head. Nostrils large, nearly circular, and concealed.
Tail nearly equal to the wings, lengthened, graduated, or else shorter and nearly even.</p>

<p>This genus is readily distinguished from the preceding by the entire
absence of crest and of black bars on the blue of wings and tail. The
species and races hitherto described will be found detailed in the accompanying
synopsis. The characters indicated above are of no very great generic
value, but as the group is a very natural one it will be as well to retain it.
As in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanura</i>, the species are peculiar to the United States and Mexico,
one indeed being apparently confined to the Peninsula of Florida.</p>

<p>In the first section of this group we see the same indication of variation
from a common type with the region that is so evident in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanura</i>. Thus,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanocitta woodhousei</i> differs from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">californica</i>, much as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanura macrolopha</i>
does from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. stelleri</i> (<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">frontalis</i>), in more slender bill and a greater
percentage of blue; this invading the back and under parts, the lower tail-coverts
especially. But here the parallel of modification ends, for the
Mexican representative of the species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. sumichrasti</i>) appears to revert
back to the characters of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">californica</i>, having like it a minimum amount of
blue, though this almost obliterates the superciliary stripe of white. In
this respect there is more resemblance to the case of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pipilo fusca</i> and its
three races in the three regions inhabited by these representative forms of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanocitta californica</i>; for, while the Mexican (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. fusca</i>) and Californian (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.

is more different from the two extreme races than they are from each
other.</p>

<p>In the other section of the genus the relation between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arizonæ</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sordida</i> is a parallel to that between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanura macrolopha</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. coronata</i>;
the southern forms (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sordida</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coronata</i>) differing principally in the greater
intensity and prevalence or amount of the blue. The relations of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">couchi</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultramarina</i> to the two above mentioned are yet obscure, owing to the
small material at command,&mdash;there being only two specimens of the former,
and none of the latter, in the National Museum at Washington.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Florida only, and quite local.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This beautiful species appears to be exclusively confined to
the peninsula of Florida, and there is no authentic evidence that it has ever
been found outside of the limits of that State. The statement of Bonaparte,
that these birds are found in the States of Louisiana and Kentucky, has
never been confirmed, and Mr. Audubon, who was for many years a resident
of both States and familiar with the birds of each, was very positive the
statement was without foundation. It has never been observed even in
Georgia or Alabama, and Mr. Nuttall states that it is not found in any part
of West Florida.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen, in his recent paper on the winter birds of East Florida, speaking
of this species, states that it is numerous in the scrub, but does not appear
to frequent the pine woods, the hummocks, or the swamps. He saw none
along the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s, except at Blue Springs, but they occur in numbers a
few miles back from the river.</p>

<p>Dr. Bryant, in his Notes on the birds of Florida, mentions that this species
is tolerably plentiful in the vicinity of Enterprise. He regarded it
as exceedingly interesting on account of its limited geographical distribution.
With no apparent obstacle to its movements, it is yet confined to
a small part of the peninsula of Florida, its area of distribution north and
south not exceeding three degrees of latitude, if so much. He saw none
north of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine, and none south of Jupiter’s Inlet. So far as he
observed them, they were exclusively confined to the growth of scrub-oak,
which in many places is so entangled with creeping plants that it is impossible
to walk through without cutting a path. This growth is generally
found on elevated ridges running parallel to the sea-coast. The most extensive
of these, near Enterprise, is about three miles wide, and eighty feet
above the lake.</p>

<p>The flight of this species is said by Mr. Audubon to be performed at a
short distance from the ground, and to consist either of a single sailing
sweep, as it passes from one tree to another, or of continuous flappings with
a slightly undulating motion, in the manner of the Canada Jay. Its notes
are described as softer than those of the Blue Jay, and more frequently
uttered. Its motions are also quicker and more abrupt. Its food is said to
consist of snails, which it collects on the ground, insects, and various kinds
of fruits and berries. It is also charged with being very destructive of eggs
and young birds.</p>

<p>The Florida Jay is said to be easily kept in confinement, feeding readily
on dried or fresh fruit and the kernels of various nuts, and soon appears to
be reconciled to its loss of liberty. It secures its food between its feet, and
breaks it into pieces before swallowing it. In this way it feeds on the acorn
of the live-oak, snails, and the seeds of the sword-palmetto.</p>

<p><!--321.png--><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 287]</span>
The nest of this Jay is formed of dry sticks, placed across each other,
and, although rounded in form, is so lightly made that the birds may be
seen through its interstices. It is lined with fibrous rootlets. Only one
brood is raised in a season. Audubon’s descriptions of its eggs are inaccurate,
and only applicable to those of the Blue Jay.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon observed a pair of these birds in confinement in New
Orleans. They were fed upon rice and dry fruit. At dessert they were
allowed their liberty, when they would fly to the table, feed on the almonds
given them, and drink claret diluted with water. They attempted to mimic
various sounds, but did so very imperfectly.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall states that at the approach of winter these birds retire to the
south of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine. He regards their voice as less harsh than that of
the Blue Jay, and states that they have a variety of notes, some of which
are probably imitations, and are said to resemble the song of the Wood
Thrush and the calls of the common Jay.</p>

<p>An egg of the Florida Jay before me is of a rounded oval shape, being
nearly equally obtuse at either end. The ground-color is a light bluish-gray,
marked almost exclusively at the larger end with a few small spots of a light
rufous-brown. It has no near resemblance to the eggs of the California Jay,
nor to those of any other Jay that I have seen. It measures 1.05 inches
by .80.</p>

<p>In its flight and action, Dr. Bryant thought the Florida Jay resembled
the Mocking-Bird. It has none of the restless, suspicious manner of the
Blue Jay. He never heard it utter more than a single note, this being
much softer than the usual cry of the Blue Jay; its song he regarded as
rather monotonous. It seldom flies more than a short distance at a time,
and seems to trust for protection to the difficulty of access to its abode. It
also evinces a great partiality for particular localities. Generally only a
single pair is seen at a time, though in one place he has seen three pairs
together. It is not fond of civilization, and is seldom known to frequent
the vicinity of dwellings.</p>

<p>A nest found by Dr. Bryant on the 15th of April was built in a scrub-oak
about three feet from the ground. It was made of small twigs, compactly
and carefully lined with fibres of the dwarf palmetto, that had apparently
been brought a distance of half a mile. The cavity measured about
five inches in breadth and one and a half in depth. The nest contained
three eggs of a light blue, sparingly sprinkled with rufous, the spots being
larger and more numerous towards the larger end. Another nest, found a
few days later, contained five eggs of a more neutral tint, with the spots
darker, larger, and more evenly distributed.</p>

<p>Specimens from Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas are rather smaller and perhaps whiter
beneath than elsewhere; those from the eastern slope of Sierra Nevada are
very large. Upon a careful
comparison, we find that the
supposed specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. californica</i>
in the Smithsonian collection
from Mexico (Orizaba,
etc.) constitute a quite different
form, characterized by very
indistinct superciliary white
and bluish edges to throat
and jugular feathers, and especially
by the lengthened
wings, which average 5.75
inches instead of 5.00. In
general respects the resemblance,
as suggested by Sclater, is to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">californica</i>, and not to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">woodhousei</i>.
The dorsal patch is very distinct.</p>

John Gould, differs again in having the dorsal patch obscured by a bluish
wash; an unusual amount of blue edging to the throat and jugular feathers,
and a dull brownish tinge to the belly. It almost suggests the possibility
of a hybrid form between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sumichrasti</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultramarina</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The California Jay appears to be a Pacific coast species, occurring
from the Columbia River southward to Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, but not
found in the interior at any considerable distance from the coast. Mr.
Ridgway speaks of it as the Valley Jay of California, having been observed
by him in abundance only among the oaks of the Sacramento Valley, the
brushwood of the ravines, and the scattered pines of the foot-hills along the
western base of the Sierra Nevada. It was also quite common, in April, in
the vicinity of Carson City, where he found it breeding. Its notes and
manners, he adds, are very similar to those of the Woodhouse Jay, belonging
to the wooded regions of the interior, but the shrill cries of this species are
even more piercing. There is, moreover, something in its appearance, caused
by the sharp contrast of the bright blue, the light ash, and the pure white
colors, by which it may be distinguished at a glance from the more uniformly
colored <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">woodhousei</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Heerman speaks of it as frequenting to some extent the same districts
as Steller’s Jay, but also found in greater abundance throughout the valleys.
He likewise describes it as noisy, alert, and cunning in its habits,
wild and wary, and yet often seeking the habitations of man, near which
to rear its young, drawn thither by the abundance of food found in such
localities. Their nests, he states, are built in a thick-leaved bush, or on the
lower branches of an oak, at but little height from the ground. They are
constructed of twigs, and are lined with fine rootlets. The eggs, four in
number, are, he says, emerald-green in color, profusely dotted with umber-brown
spots.</p>

<p>Dr. Newberry states that he found the trees and the thickets bordering
the streams in the valleys the favorite haunts of the California Jay. As
his party ascended among the evergreen forests of the higher grounds, and
passed northeasterly from the Sacramento Valley, these birds were no
longer met with, and long before reaching the Oregon line they lost sight
of it altogether. Nor did they meet with it again until their return to
California. This Jay, he adds, has all the sprightliness and restlessness of
the family, but is less noisy, and its notes are far more agreeable than those
of Steller’s Jay, by which it is replaced at the north.</p>

<p>The Smithsonian Museum has a specimen of this species obtained on the
Columbia by Townsend, and Mr. Nuttall mentions that early in October,
on arriving at the forests of the Columbia, near Fort Vancouver, he met
with it in company with Steller’s Jay. They were breeding in the dark
pine woods, and by the 15th of June they were feeding their fully fledged
young. He also states that they were found as far north as Fraser’s River,
migrating to the south at the approach of winter. Without questioning the
<!--326.png--><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 290]</span>
correctness of this statement, it is worthy of mention that these birds have
not been met there by more recent collectors, and that Dr. Newberry nowhere
met with them in Oregon. Dr. Cooper suggests that, since then, the
increased severity of the winters may have driven them permanently farther
south.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall describes its habits as very much like those of the Blue Jay.
It usually flies out to the tops of the tallest pines, jerks its tail, and perches
playfully on some extreme branch, where, as if in anger, it calls <i class="birdcall">woit, woit-woit</i>,
with an occasional recognition note of <i class="birdcall">twee-twee</i>. When pursued, it
retreats to the shade of the loftiest branches. It feeds on insects, acorns,
which it breaks up, and pine seeds. He describes it as a graceful, active,
and shy bird, with a note much less harsh and loud than that of Steller’s
Jay.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper remarks that this species is one of the most common and
conspicuous of the birds of the State of California. They frequent every
locality in which oak-trees are found, even within the limits of large towns,
where they enter gardens and audaciously plunder the fruit. They have all
the usual cunning of their tribe, and when alarmed become very quiet, and
conceal themselves in the thick foliage. They are usually noisy and fearless,
and their odd cries, grotesque actions, and bright plumage make them
general favorites in spite of their depredations. They are also said to have
a talent for mimicry, besides notes to express their various wants and ideas.</p>

<p>They breed abundantly throughout the western parts of California, and
construct a large and strong nest of twigs, roots, and grass. These are
placed in a low tree or bush. They lay about five eggs, which Dr. Cooper
describes as dark green marked with numerous pale brown blotches and
spots, and measure 1.80 by 1.04 inches. At San Diego he found these eggs
laid as early as April 5.</p>

<p>This Jay inhabits the Coast Range of mountains to their summit, south
of San Francisco, and the Sierra Nevada as far as the oaks extend, or to an
elevation of from 1,000 to 5,000 feet. Dr. Cooper saw none on the east side
of the Sierra Nevada in latitude 39<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>.</p>

<p>He describes their flight as slow and laborious, on account of their short
wings, and states that they never fly far at a time. He also accuses them
of being very destructive to the eggs of smaller birds, hunting for them in
the spring, and watching the movements of other birds with great attention.</p>

<p>Mr. Xantus found these birds very abundant at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, being,
like all the other resident species there, much smaller than those occurring
in more northern localities. Their habits are said to be very much the
same.</p>

<p>This species was taken in winter near Oaxaca, Mexico, by Mr. Boucard.</p>

<p>Four eggs of this species from different parts of California present the
following measurements: 1.20 × 0.85; 1.10 × 0.80; 1.13 × 0.80; 1.05 × 0.80.
The measurements given by Dr. Cooper we are confident must be a mistake.
<!--327.png--><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 291]</span>
Their ground-color is a bright, but not a dark, emerald-green; and they are
marked and blotched with faint purplish-brown, and deeper spots of dark
umber. These spots are sparingly distributed, and are chiefly about the
larger end. In one they are wholly of a light violet-brown. These eggs are
of a perfectly oval shape.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles D. Gibbes, of Stockton, writes that he found in a garden in
that city a nest built by a pair of these birds that had become half domesticated.
It was placed in a very thick arbor of honeysuckle. The body of
the nest was composed of clippings from a hedge of osage orange, with thorns
on them half an inch long. These twigs were tied and interlaced with twine
and bits of cotton strings. Within this frame was a layer of fine weeds and
grasses nicely arranged, the whole lined with horse-hair. The nest was
found in May, and contained five eggs. The parents kept a good deal
about the kitchen door, and would steal anything they had an opportunity
to take. They made use of an old nest in the same garden as a receptacle
for their stolen goods; among other things was found a large slice of bread-and-butter.</p>

it, that wherever he found the piñon, or nut-pine (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinus edulis</i>), growing
in New Mexico, this bird was sure to be there in great numbers, feeding
upon the fruit of those trees. Among the men it was known as the piñon
bird. Its notes are said to be harsh and disagreeable. It was extremely
<!--328.png--><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 292]</span>
restless, and was continually in motion, flying from tree to tree, uttering its
well-known cries.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway calls this a very interesting species, and states that it was
found very abundant in the fertile cañons of the West Humboldt Mountains,
as well as in all the extensive nut-pine and cedar woods to the eastward. On
the Toyaba and East Humboldt Mountains, and the extensive piñon woods in
Southern Idaho, it was equally common. In Utah, in the cañons of the
Wahsatch Mountains, it was occasionally seen, though oftener observed in
the valley of the Weber. When unmolested, this bird is, he states, very
unsuspicious, and anything unusual at once excites its curiosity. Often
when at work, in camp, skinning birds, on the edge of bushes, one of them
would approach within a few feet, and quietly watch every movement. At
Unionsville they were quite common in the gardens and around the door-yards
of the town, and were very familiar and unsuspicious. Their cries
greatly resembled those of the California Jay, and consisted of a repetition
of harsh screeching notes.</p>

<p>This species, according to Dr. Coues, is a resident and a very abundant
species in Arizona, where it is one of the most characteristic species. It
was found in all situations, but seemed to shun dense pine woods, and to
prefer to keep on the open hillsides, among the scrub-oaks, etc. In winter
it collects in rather large flocks, sometimes as many as fifty together. They
are, however, usually seen in small groups of six or seven individuals.
They are said to be a restless, vigilant, shy, and noisy species.</p>

<p>Mr. C. E. Aiken found this bird a common and resident species in Colorado.
He met with it along the foot of the mountains, in brush thickets, in
which they also breed. The base and periphery of a nest found by him were
composed of dead twigs, intermingled within with fine rootlets and horsehair.
The eggs, four or five in number, are said to be laid about the first of
May. They have a ground-color of a light bluish-green, and marked with
reddish-brown specks, thickest at the larger end. They are of a rounded
oval shape, much more pointed at one end, and rounded at the other, and
average 1.06 inches in length by .80 of an inch in breadth.</p>

Tail rounded, but little graduated; lateral feather about a quarter of an
inch shortest. Wings longer than the tail; when closed, reaching nearly to its middle.
Above and on sides of head and neck bright blue; the lores blackish; the middle of the
back slightly duller, the tips of some of the feathers dark brown. Beneath brownish-ash,
paler on the chin and towards the anal region, which, with the crissum, is white. No
trace of white or black on the sides of the head, nor of any streaks or collar on the
breast. Length, (fresh,) 11.50; wing, 6.00; tail, (dried,) 5.40; tarsus, 1.50.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
South side of valley of Rio Grande, near the coast, and southward.</p>

<p>This well-marked species is quite different in form from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. californica</i>,
having a shorter, more even tail, much longer wings, and stouter feet. The
absence of any collar or streaks on the breast and throat, of black or white
on the side of the head, and of decided ash on the back, are very well
marked features. There is also much more green in the blue of the head.</p>

<p>As suggested in the <abbr title="Pacific Railroad Routes">P. R. R.</abbr> Report, the birds collected by Lieutenant Couch
at Monterey, Mexico, although agreeing almost exactly with the original description
of Bonaparte, are much smaller, and perhaps entitled to recognition
as a separate form. The tail is nearly two inches less, 5.40 instead of 7.00,
or over.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Ultramarine Jay is a well-marked species, and is specifically
quite distinct from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. californica</i>. It is found in the valley of the Rio
Grande, and thence southward and eastward in the northern provinces of
<!--332.png--><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 294]</span>
Mexico. Though we know of no specimens having been procured on this
side of the boundary line, their occurrence is quite probable. Lieutenant
Couch met with this species near Monterey, Mexico, and from thence west
to Parras. He describes it as being gregarious and eminently Jay-like
in its habits. They are very noisy and vociferous in their outcries, and
three or four of them suffice to keep a whole forest in an uproar. Near
Guyapuco a large snake (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Georgia obsoleta</i>) was seen pursued by three or four
of this species. The reptile was making every effort to escape from their combined
attacks, and would, no doubt, have been killed by them, had they not
been interfered with. The cause of so much animosity against the snake
was explained when, on opening its stomach, three young of this species,
about two thirds grown, were found.</p>

<p>In the Department of Vera Cruz, Sumichrast found what he calls <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C.
ultramarina</i> in company with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanura coronata</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanocitta nana, “californica</i>”
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sumichrasti</i>), and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sordida</i>, occurring in the alpine region, and
with the three first named restricted to that locality. The limit of their
extension is about that of the alpine region, that is, from an elevation
of about 4,500 feet to the height of 10,500 feet. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sordida</i> is also found on
the plateau.</p>

to the yellow-bellied <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">guatemalensis</i>; but intermediate localities show different
proportions of the two colors. The nasal tufts in the first do not
extend beyond the nasal fossæ; and the frontal yellowish is very narrow.
In the second these tufts reach beyond the fossæ, and the frontal yellowish
is more extended. In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">incas</i> again the nasal tufts have reached their
maximum, while the frontal yellowish extends over the whole cap, leaving

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Within the limits of the United States this beautiful species
has thus far been only met with in
Southeastern Texas in the lower valley
of the Rio Grande. It was first
described in 1839, by <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Lesson, a
French naturalist, from a Mexican
specimen, and in 1851 was first
brought to our notice as a bird of the
United States by Mr. Geo. N. Lawrence
of New York. Specimens of
this bird were obtained by the party
of the Mexican Boundary Survey,
and by Lieutenant Couch on the Rio
Grande, at Matamoras, New Leon, and
San Diego, Mexico. The only note
as to its habits by Lieutenant Couch is to the effect that it eats seeds and
insects.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Berlandier of Matamoras obtained specimens of this bird in
the vicinity of that city, which were found among his collections. Among
his manuscript notes occurs a description of the plumage and habits of
this species, which he had described under the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pica cervantesii</i>.
In this he states that this bird inhabits the whole eastern coast of Mexico,
but that he has only met with it on the banks of the Rio Bravo del Norte,
in the vicinity of Matamoras. It is said to be both carnivorous and graminivorous,
and comes about the houses in search of the refuse. Although it
can swallow whole grains of corn, before eating it breaks them with its
beak, holding them between its claws, in the manner of birds of prey, and
biting with great force. It is commonly known as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pajaro verde</i>, or Greenbird.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser states that this species was common on the lower Rio Grande
during the winter, but was not found on the Upper Rio Grande or in Texas,
except as a straggler from Mexico.</p>

<p>This bird, Mr. Sumichrast states, is common throughout the Department
of Vera Cruz, where it is generally known by the name of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Verde detoca</i> and
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Sonaja</i>. It is said to be one of the birds most generally diffused throughout
the whole department. It inhabits both the hot and the temperate
regions, and is found even at the foot of the alpine, to the altitude of nearly
six thousand feet above the sea. It is also said to be abundant in other
parts of Mexico. It was observed to be quite numerous on the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Tierra
templada</i>, or table-lands, and also among the hills that bound the plains of
Perote and Puebla on the east, by Mr. William S. Pease, a naturalist who
<!--335.png--><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 297]</span>
was with General Scott’s army in its campaign in Mexico. Mr. Pease stated
that it lived on the sides of the hills throughout the year, and that its local
name was <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pepe verde</i>.</p>

<p>Colonel George A. McCall, Inspector-General of the United States Army,
was the first person to collect these birds within our limits. He obtained
them in the forests that border the Rio Grande on the southeastern frontier
of Texas. There he found them all mated in the month of May, and
he felt no doubt that they had their nests in the extensive and almost
impenetrable thickets of mimosa, commonly called chaparral. From the
jealousy and pugnacity which these birds manifested on the approach, or
appearance even, of the large boat-tailed Blackbirds of that country (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quiscalus
macrurus</i>), which were nesting in great numbers in the vicinity, Colonel
McCall was satisfied that the Jays were at that time also engaged in the
duties of incubation and rearing their young. In character and temperament
these birds appeared to be very active and lively, though less noisy than
some other species of the family. Their gay plumage was exhibited to great
advantage as they flitted from tree to tree, or dashed boldly in pursuit of
such of their more plainly attired neighbors as ventured to intrude upon
their domain.</p>

<p>Captain J. P. McCown, also quoted by Mr. Cassin, furnishes some
additional observations in regard to these birds. He states that during the
several years that he was in Texas, he frequently saw these Jays, but never
met with them above Ringgold Barracks, or north of the woods that skirt
the Rio Grande. They seemed to prefer the acacia groves which have
sprung up where the ground has been overflowed. He regards it as a rather
cautious bird. He observed nests high up in the trees above mentioned,
which he supposes belong to this species, though this was never positively
ascertained. He had no doubt that they breed in Texas.</p>

Feathers lax and full, especially on the back, and of very dull colors, without
any blue. Head without distinct crest. Bill very short; broader than high. Culmen
scarcely half the length of the head; straight to near the tip, then slightly curved; gonys
more curved than culmen. Bill notched at tip. Nostrils round, covered by bristly feathers.
Tail about equal to the wings; graduated. Tarsi rather short; but little longer
than the middle toe. Plumage very soft, and without any lustre.</p>

<p>The Canada Jay has a near ally in a species of northern Europe and
Siberia,&mdash;the Siberian Jay (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. infaustus</i>). In size and proportions the two
are quite identical, there being about the same proportionate length of wing
and tail, and a general correspondence in the minutiæ of external anatomy.

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Canada Jay was procured at Fort Simpson by Mr. Kennicott
in August, September, and December, and at the same point by Mr.
Ross in March and April, in the years 1860 and 1861. It was found breeding
<!--338.png--><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 300]</span>
in May at Anderson River Fort by Mr. MacFarlane. It was also procured
at Big Island by Mr. Reid, at Nulato and Unalakleet by Mr. Dall, at
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s by Colonel Bulkley, at Fort Kenai by Bischoff, and at Fort Rae
by Mr. Clarke. From the memoranda of Mr. MacFarlane, we have valuable
information in regard to the nesting and breeding habits of this species. May
24, at Fort Anderson, an Indian lad discovered a nest of this Jay. It was
built in a tree, was composed of hay and feathers, and contained, with two
young birds a few days old, an egg that was perfectly fresh. This bird, Mr.
MacFarlane states, is tolerably numerous in that quarter. During the severe
cold of winter it is not quite so common as at other seasons. It is by no
means a difficult bird to shoot, as it will always venture into close proximity
to man. Flesh or fish are certain to attract numbers of them, and
they also cause great annoyance to the marten-hunter, by eating the bait
placed in the traps used for capturing those animals. None of this species
were observed on the Arctic coast, nor east of Horton River, Fort Anderson
being the most northern point where Mr. MacFarlane saw any, in his journeys
across the barren grounds.</p>

<p>Other nests found in the same region were usually built in spruce-trees,
on branches near the trunk, well concealed from view, and about ten feet
from the ground. They were constructed of hay and feathers, supported
underneath by a few willow sticks laid crosswise.</p>

<p>Mr. Dall characterizes this species as a very bold and familiar bird, that
will frequently fly down and steal away his dinner from some hungry dog,
if he is not on the alert, or devour the fish hung up in camp by the Indians
to dry. They breed very early, and occupy the same nest year after year.
The nest is very large, and composed entirely of soft materials, moss, hair,
and the like. On the 20th of April, Mr. Dall received a nest of this Jay
containing four half-fledged young, so that they must lay in March. The
bird was abundant everywhere on the Yukon River.</p>

<p>These birds are known throughout the fur countries by the name of
Whiskey-Jack, not from any supposed predilection for that beverage, but
probably, as Mr. Kennicott has suggested, from a corruption of the Indian
name for these birds, Wiss-ka-chon, which has been contorted into Whiskey-John
and thence into Whiskey-Jack. Richardson observed these birds from
Canada to the fur countries as far as latitude 69<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. Throughout that region
it is a constant attendant at the fur-posts and fishing-stations, and becomes
so tame in the winter as to feed from the hand. Yet it is impatient of confinement,
and soon pines away if deprived of its liberty. Its voice is said to
be plaintive and squeaking, though it occasionally makes a low chattering.
It hoards berries, pieces of meat, etc., in hollow trees, or between layers of
bark, by which it is enabled to feed its young while the ground is still
covered with snow.</p>

<p>Dr. Newberry found this Jay as far to the south, in California, as the
upper end of the Sacramento Valley, in latitude 40<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. The fact that the
<!--339.png--><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 301]</span>
isothermal line of this region passes south of Cincinnati, shows that climate
and temperature do not regulate the range of this species. As observed in
the summer months among the forests of Oregon, the Canada Jay appeared
as a rather shy bird, exhibiting none of the familiarity and impudence exhibited
in winter when made bold by hunger.</p>

<p>Wilson mentions the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence as the southern boundary of this bird,
a few only wintering in Northern New York and Vermont. But this is
inexact. They are found resident throughout the year in a large part of
Maine and in all the highlands of New Hampshire and Vermont. They
are resident at Calais, where they breed in March at about latitude 45<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, and
descend in the winter to the southwest corner of Vermont, whence it is
quite probable a few cross into Massachusetts, at Williamstown and Adams,
though none have been detected, that I am aware. Wilson himself states
that he was informed by a gentleman residing near Hudson, <abbr title="New York"><span class="sc">N. Y.</span></abbr>, that these
birds have been observed in that neighborhood in the winter.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues met with these birds in Labrador. The first he saw were in a
dense spruce forest. These were very shy, alighting only on the tops of the
tallest trees, and flying off with loud harsh screams on his approach. Subsequently,
at Rigolet, he found them abundant and very familiar. One or
more were always to be seen hopping unconcernedly in the garden-patches
around the houses, not in the least disturbed by the near presence of man,
and showing no signs of fear even when very closely approached. He
describes their voice as a harsh, discordant scream.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Harris, of Moorestown, <abbr title="New Jersey">N. J.</abbr>, informed Mr. Audubon, that
once, when fishing in a canoe in one of the lakes in the interior of Maine,
these Jays were so fearless as to light on one end of his boat while he sat in
the other, and helped themselves to his bait without taking any notice of
him.</p>

<p>A nest of the Canada Jay, found by Mr. Boardman near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s,
New Brunswick, measures four and a half inches in diameter and three
inches in height. The cavity is about three inches wide and two deep. The
nest is woven above a rude platform of sticks and twigs crossed and interlaced,
furnishing a roughly made hemispherical base and periphery. Upon
this an inner and more artistic nest has been wrought, made of a soft felting
of fine mosses closely impacted and lined with feathers. The nest contained
three eggs.</p>

<p>The egg of the Canada Jay measures 1.20 inches in length, by .82 of an
inch in breadth. They are of an oblong-oval shape, and are more tapering
at the smaller end than are most of the eggs of this family. The ground-color
is of a light gray, with a slightly yellowish tinge over the entire
egg, finely marked, more abundantly about the larger end, with points
and blotches of slate-color and brown, and faint cloudings of an obscure
lilac.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Dr. Cooper met with this variety at the mouth of the Columbia
River in March in small scattered flocks, industriously seeking insects and
seeds among the spruce-trees, occasionally whistling in a loud melodious
tone like that of the Cardinal Grosbeak. He also states that the notes of this
bird differ much from the other Jays in being clear and musical, and they
sometimes show a considerable variety of song.</p>

<p>This Jay, Mr. Lord states, is so familiar and confiding, and so fond of
being near the habitations of man, that the settlers never harm it. In the
cold weather he has seen it hop by the fire, ruffle up its feathers and
warm itself without the least fear, keeping a sharp lookout for crumbs, and
looking so beseechingly with its glittering gray eyes, that no one could
refuse such an appeal for a stray morsel. It winters in British Columbia
and Vancouver Island.</p>

<p>This genus embraces Jays of large size and very dull plumage. The thick
bill, with the much curved culmen, the moderate tail, and the open nostrils,
may serve to distinguish it from its allies. The nostril is very large, and its
anterior portion is bevelled off to a greater degree than in any genus, except
in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calocitta</i>. This last-mentioned genus has the same form of bill and of
nostrils, but the head has a long recurved crest; the tail is twice as long as
the wings; the lateral feather nearly half the middle; the lateral tarsal
plates scutellate for the inferior half, etc.</p>

<p>A series of specimens of this species exhibits considerable diversities.
Some skins from Mirador, <abbr title="Mexico">Mex.</abbr>, not far from Vera Cruz, perhaps best represent
the species as first described by Wagler. In these the head and neck
are sooty-brown, becoming lighter on the jugulum and on the back. The
wings and tail show a trace of dull bluish. In <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 23,915 the under parts
are sooty-gray, the bill and legs black; in 23,916 the colors are similar,
<!--343.png--><!--Plate 42-->
<!--344.png--><!--blank page-->
<!--345.png--><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 305]</span>
with a fulvous tinge on the breast, the bill and feet yellow. In both the
under surface of tail is brown to the end. In 23,917 the under parts, from
breast to crissum inclusive, with the tibiæ, are brownish-white, the tail-feathers
(excepting the two median) tipped with white for over an inch, the
bill and feet black. This one also has an obscure dull bluish wash or
patch along the feathers of the ramus of lower jaw not observed in other
specimens.</p>

<p>The specimens collected by Lieutenant Couch, and described in the Pacific
Railroad Report are considerably smaller, and exhibit other differences which
may prove of specific importance. In this case they will appropriately bear
Rüppell’s name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. mexicanus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This is a Mexican species, occasionally extending its movements
as far north as the valley of the Rio Grande, and probably crossing our lines
into Texas, although of this there is as yet no positive evidence.</p>

<p>Specimens of this species were procured by Lieutenant Couch at Boquillo,
San Diego, and at China, in north-eastern Mexico, and were found by him
living in forests of high trees. It is Jay-like in its habits, being decidedly
gregarious, and having harsh and loud notes. Though making more noise
than any other bird in the neighborhood, if one of their number is brought
down by the discharge of a gun, the noise hushes them at once, and the rest
move off in perfect silence.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumichrast, in his paper on the Distribution of the Birds of Vera
Cruz, states that this species abounds in both the hot and the temperate
regions of that department, and, indeed, the greater portions of Vera Cruz.
He speaks of it as a bird well known and generally detested on account of
its troublesome and noisy habits. It is found everywhere except in the
alpine region, and it does not appear ever to go beyond a vertical elevation
of 4,500 feet. This gentleman has been assured that the bird never makes
any nest of its own, but invariably lays its eggs in those belonging to other
birds. He does not so state, but we infer that he means to convey the idea
that this Jay appropriates the nests of other birds in which to hatch its own
young, not that, like the Cowbird, it leaves its eggs to be brought up by
strangers.</p>

<p>This Jay was met with by Mr. G. C. Taylor at Taulevi, in Honduras; and
from that place eastward, as far as the Atlantic, he found it very common.
It was generally seen or heard shrieking in the bushes by the roadsides. It
was also found by Mr. Salvin to occur on the eastern road between Quiriqua
and Iguana, on the road to Guatemala.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Leyland found this species common both in Honduras and
the Belize. It occurred in small flocks, which were very noisy, and annoyed
the hunter by always giving the alarm.</p>

<h2>
<span class="sc">Family</span> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">TYRANNIDÆ</span>.&mdash;<span class="sc">Tyrant Flycatchers.</span></h2>

<p class="small"><span class="sc">Primary Characters.</span> Primaries ten. Bill in typical forms broad, triangular, much
depressed, abruptly decurved and notched at tip, with long bristles along gape. Tarsi with
scutellæ extending round the outer face of tarsus from the front to back; sometimes
divided on the outer side. Bill with culmen nearly as long as the head, or shorter;
straight to near the tip, then suddenly bent down into a conspicuous hook, with a notch
behind it; tip of lower jaw also notched. Commissure straight to near the notch; gonys
slightly convex. Nostrils oval or rounded, in the anterior extremity of the nasal groove,
and more or less concealed by long bristles which extend from the posterior angle of the
jaws along the base of the bill, becoming smaller, but reaching nearly to the median line
of the forehead. These bristles with lateral branches at the base. Similar bristles are
mixed in the loral feathers and margin the chin. Tarsi short, generally less than middle
toe, completely enveloped by a series of large scales, which meet near the posterior edge
of the inner side, and are separated either by naked skin or by a row of small scales.
Sometimes a second series of rather large plates is seen on the posterior face of the tarsus,
these, however, usually on the upper extremity only. Basal joint of middle toe united
almost throughout to that of the outer toe, but more than half free on the inner side;
outer lateral toe rather the longer. Wings and tail variable; first quill always more than
three fourths the second. The outer primaries sometimes attenuated near the tip.</p>

<p>The primary characters given above will serve to distinguish the North
American <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyrannidæ</i> from their allies; the essential features consisting in
the peculiarity of the scales of the tarsus and the ten primaries. In the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvicolidæ</i> there are species as truly “flycatching,” and with a depressed
bristly bill, but the nine (not ten) primaries, and the restriction of the scales
to the anterior face of the tarsus, instead of extending entirely round the
outer side, will readily separate them.</p>

<p>The relationships of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyrannidæ</i> are closest to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cotingidæ</i>. These
last differ mainly in having the tarsus more or less reticulated, or covered in
part at least with small angular scales, instead of continuous broad ones;
and in the greater adhesion of the toes. The legs are shorter, and the body
broader and more depressed. The bill is less abundantly provided with
bristles, and the species do not appear to be strictly flycatchers, feeding
more on berries and on stationary insects and larvæ, rather than capturing
them on the wing. Two species of this family, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hadrostomus affinis</i><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_62" id="fnanchor_62"></a><a href="#footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></span>

Grande, not far from the border of the United States, but as they have not
yet been detected within our limits, we have concluded to omit them in the
present work.</p>

<p>The bird fauna of America may be said to have one of its chief features
in the great number and variety of its <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyrannidæ</i>, the family being strictly
a New World one. Nearly every possible diversity of form is exhibited by
different members; the size, however, usually varying from that of our common
Robin to that of the Kinglet, our smallest bird with exception of the
Humming-Bird. Of the numerous subfamilies, however, only one, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyranninæ</i> proper, belongs to North America, and will be readily distinguished
from other of our land birds by the family characters given at the
head of this article, and which, as drawn up, apply rather to the subfamily
than to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyrannidæ</i> generally.</p>

<p>The North American species of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyranninæ</i> may, for our present
purposes, be divided into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyranni</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyrannuli</i>. The former are large,
generally with bright color, pointed wings, with attenuated primaries and a
colored crest in the middle of the crown. The others are plainer, smaller,
without colored crest; the primaries not attenuated.</p>

<p>The genera of our Flycatchers may be arranged as follows:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="comchar"><b class="birdname">TYRANNI.</b> Size large; colors generally brilliant; crown with a brightly
colored crest, usually concealed; outer primaries abruptly contracted or attenuated
near the tip; upper scales of tarsus usually continuing round on the outside
and behind. Nest in trees, very bulky, containing much downy material; eggs
white or pinkish, with ovate dots of rich brown, of various shades.</p>

<p class="indent2"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Milvulus.</b> Tail excessively forked and lengthened; more than twice
as long as the wings.</p>

<p class="indent2"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyrannus.</b> Tail moderate; nearly even or slightly forked; less than
the wings.</p>

<p class="comchar"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">TYRANNULI.</b> Size generally small; colors usually plain; crown without
any colored crest concealed by the tips of the feathers; primaries normal; scales
of the upper part of the tarsus usually continuing only to the middle of the
outer face, and a second series opposite to them behind.</p>

<p class="indent1">1. Tail lengthened; about equal to the wings, which reach scarcely to its
middle.</p>

<p class="indent2"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myiarchus.</b> Tarsus equal to the middle toe, which is decidedly longer
than the hinder one. Tail even or rounded. Throat pale ash, rest of
lower parts yellow generally, the primaries edged with rufous, and
inner webs of tail-feathers with more or less of the same color. Nest
in a cavity of a tree, of loose material; eggs whitish, with intricate
tangled lines and streaks of dark brown, the general effect salmon-color.</p>

<p class="indent2"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sayornis.</b> Tarsus rather longer than the middle toe, which is scarcely
longer than the hind toe. Tail slightly forked. Bill very narrow. No
light orbital ring, nor distinct bands on wings; both mandibles black.

containing much mud in its composition; eggs pure white, immaculate,
or with very minute sparse dots near larger end.</p>

<p class="indent1">2. Tail decidedly shorter than the wings, which reach beyond its middle.
Tarsus shorter than the middle toe.</p>

<p class="indent2">

forked. Wings long, pointed; much longer than the tail, reaching beyond
the middle of the latter; first quill about equal to the fourth. Bill
broad. Color olive-gray, and white, sometimes with a yellowish tinge
beneath. Lower mandible pale-colored. Nest saucer-shaped, compact,
and very small, saddled very securely upon a thick branch; eggs cream-colored,
with a zone of lilac and rich brown blotches round the larger end.</p>

<p class="indent1">3. Tail shorter than the wings, as in the last. Tarsus considerably longer
than the middle toe; hind toe much longer than lateral. Tail nearly even,
sometimes slightly rounded, but little shorter than the wings; first primary
much shorter than the fourth.</p>

<p class="indent2"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Empidonax.</b> Head moderately crested; tail about even. Bristles of
bill reaching about half-way to tip. Legs stout. A conspicuous light
orbital ring, and distinct bands on the wing. More or less tinged
with sulphur-yellow on lower parts. Nest variously constructed,
deeply cup-shaped, compact or loose, entirely of either grassy or fibrous
and downy material, and fixed to slender twigs or lodged in a crotch
between thick branches; eggs white, immaculate, or with blotches of
brown round larger end.</p>

<p class="indent2"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mitrephorus.</b> Head decidedly crested. Tail forked. Bristles of bill
reaching nearly to tip. Legs very weak and slender. Beneath more
or less tinged with fulvous or ochraceous.</p>

<p class="indent2"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyrocephalus.</b> Head with a full crest. Tarsus but little longer than
the middle toe; hind toe not longer than the lateral. Tail broad, even;
first quill shorter than the fifth. Beneath, with whole crown bright
red (except in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. obscurus</i>). Female very different, lacking the red,
except posteriorly beneath, and with the breast obsoletely streaked.</p>

Mexico to South America. Accidental in the United States. (New Jersey,
Kentucky, and Mississippi, <span class="sc">Audubon</span>.)</p>

<p>This species claims a place in the fauna of the United States on account
of two specimens captured in New Jersey, at long intervals, and one or two
seen by Mr. Audubon in the southwest. It is, however, hardly proper to
include it in our work on so slight a basis, and we only retain it for the
purpose of referring to the notice of it by Mr. Audubon.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Fork-tailed Flycatcher is of purely accidental occurrence in
the United States. Two specimens, taken at long intervals, are said to have
been captured in the United States. One of these was shot by Mr. Audubon,
in June, 1832, near the city of Camden, <abbr title="New Jersey">N. J.</abbr> It was first observed
<!--350.png--><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 310]</span>
flying over a meadow, in pursuit of insects. It afterwards alighted on the
top of a small detached tree, when it was secured. The bird appeared to
have lost its way, was unsuspicious, and paid no attention when approached.
On the wing, it seemed to make use of its long tail whenever it sought to
suddenly turn in pursuit of its prey. On the ground, it vibrated its tail in
the manner of a Sparrow-Hawk.</p>

<p>When the bird fell to the ground severely wounded, it uttered a sharp
squeak, which it repeated, accompanied by a smart clicking of the bill, when
Mr. Audubon approached it. It lived only a few moments, and from this
specimen he made his drawing.</p>

<p>Several years previous to this, one of these birds had been shot near
Henderson, <abbr title="Kentucky">Ky.</abbr>, but it was so far decayed when given to Mr. Audubon
that it could not be preserved. It had been obtained among the Barrens
late in October. Near Natchez, <abbr title="Mississippi">Miss.</abbr>, in August, 1822, Mr. Audubon was
confident he saw two others of this species. They were high in the air, and
were twittering in the manner of a Kingbird. He was, however, unable to
secure them.</p>

<p>Another straggler was obtained near Bridgton, <abbr title="New Jersey">N. J.</abbr>, early in December.
From this specimen was made the engraving in Bonaparte’s Ornithology.
It was given to Titian Peale by Mr. J. Woodcraft of that place.</p>

<p>This Flycatcher is a resident in tropical South America from Guiana to La
Plata, and in its habits resembles the swallow-tailed species of our southern
fauna. It is said to be a solitary bird, remaining perched on the limb of
a tree, from which, from time to time, it darts after passing insects; while
standing, it is said to vibrate its long tail in the manner of the European
Wagtail. It also occasionally utters a twitter not unlike the common note
of the Kingbird. Besides insects, this bird also feeds on berries, as the
bird obtained near Bridgton had its stomach distended with the fruit of the
poke-weed.</p>

<p>This species, according to Sumichrast, is found abundantly in winter in the
savannas of the hot lands of Vera Cruz, and occurs to the height of about
two thousand feet. He is not aware of its being resident.</p>

<p>Mr. Leyland found this species frequenting Old River and the pine ridges
of Belize. They were also plentiful on the flats near Peten, and were
occasionally found at Comayagua and Omoa, Honduras.</p>

<p>Mr. C. W. Wyatt met with this Flycatcher in Colombia, South America,
on the savanna in the neighborhood of Aquachica. When at Ocaña, he
used to see them congregated in considerable numbers just before sunset,
whirling round high up in the air, and darting down like rockets to the
ground. He only found it frequenting the open part of the country, and he
never met with it at a greater elevation than five thousand feet.</p>

<p>An egg of this species obtained by Dr. Baldamus, from Cayenne, exhibits
a strong resemblance to the egg of the common Kingbird. It has a clear
white ground, and is spotted with deep and prominent marking of red and

measure .90 by .68 of an inch.</p>

<p>This exquisitely beautiful and graceful bird is quite abundant on the
prairies of Southern Texas, and is everywhere conspicuous among its kindred
<!--354.png--><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 312]</span>
species. It is usually known as the Scissor-tail from the habit of closing
and opening the long feathers of the tail like the blades of a pair of scissors.
The adult female is very similar, though rather smaller. The young is not
conspicuously different, only lacking the concealed patch of the head.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Swallow-tailed Flycatcher appears to be a common species
from Central Texas to the Rio Grande, and thence throughout Mexico to
Central America, as far south at least as Guatemala. It is also found in
the Indian Territory, where it breeds, specimens of the nest and eggs having
been obtained at the Kioway Agency by Dr. E. Palmer.</p>

<p>It was found very plentiful at Langui, in Honduras, by Mr. G. C. Taylor,
and also in fewer numbers in other localities. In the evening, just before
roosting time, they were in the habit of assembling on the tops of certain
favorite trees, where they remained until nearly dark. They then all went
off to the woods. He generally met with them on open ground, not much
encumbered by trees or brushwood.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser states that he found this very graceful bird quite abundant at
Matamoras and in Western Texas, where it is known by the name of
“Texan Bird of Paradise.” He found it as far east as the river Guadaloupe.
It arrives, he states, in the neighborhood of San Antonio, late in March, and
remains until the middle or latter end of October. It breeds abundantly
near San Antonio, building its nest in a mesquite or other tree, and lays
from three to four eggs, which, as he states, are pure white, blotched with
large spots of a dark red color.</p>

<p>He adds that these birds are of a quarrelsome and fearless disposition,
rarely brooking intruders near their homes. During the breeding-season
Mr. Dresser has often, when travelling, stopped to admire four or five of
them fighting on the wing. They show their long tail-feathers and the
rich scarlet color under their wings to the fullest advantage. After passing
Guadaloupe River, he saw none of these birds to the eastward, though he
was told they have occasionally been seen on Galveston Island.</p>

<p>This Flycatcher was met with at Eagle Pass, in Lower Texas, and in
Tamaulipas by Mr. Clark and Lieutenant Couch, in the Mexican Boundary
Survey. None were found occurring west of the valley of the Rio Pecos.
Mr. Clark states that he always saw them either following one another
through the air, or perched upon some solitary twig. In their gyrations the
scissors were always more or less expanded, suggesting the idea of balancers.
Their nests were built of sticks, lined on the inside, though not
very softly, with grass, and were placed almost invariably on dry limbs
of the mesquite. They contained from three to five eggs, and, what was
quite remarkable, more than one pair always seemed to have an interest in
the same nest, over which they were all very watchful, and gave proofs of
their courage by darting at the intruders. He describes their notes as short
and sharp, without much variation, and they can be heard at quite a distance.
The Mexicans imagine that this Flycatcher lives on the brains of other birds.</p>

<p><!--355.png--><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 313]</span>
Lieutenant Couch describes the Scissor-tail as shy, but of a very lively
disposition. Usually four or more are seen in company, and seem to prefer
the thinly wooded prairies to close thickets. In beauty, Lieutenant Couch
considers it the queen of all the birds found in Northern Tamaulipas.
This superiority is not owing so much to the brilliancy of its plumage, for
in that it is excelled by several species, but to the inimitable grace and
charm of its flight. Rising from the topmost branch of some acacia, it
seems to float, rather than to fly; then descending perpendicularly, it retakes
its position, uttering its usual note. He did not see it west of the Cadereita.
Dr. Kennerly, in his march from the Gulf of Mexico into Western Texas,
frequently met with these Flycatchers along his route. He usually saw them
in the open prairie, or among the mesquite-bushes. When perched, they
were generally on the top of a bush or a tall weed, and their tails were constantly
in motion. When they darted off after some passing insect, they
usually circled around, displaying the singular bifurcation of their tail, but
seldom alighting again on the same bush. It was occasionally seen on the
open prairie, flying for a long distance near the earth, as if in search of
insects.</p>

<p>In Vera Cruz this species is an inhabitant of the hot lands. A few individuals
ascend, though very rarely, to the height of the city of Orizaba, or
about 3,700 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall states that he met with this Flycatcher rather common along
the banks of the Red River, near the confluence of the Kiamesha. He
again met them, even more frequently, near the Great Salt River of Arkansas,
in August. They seemed to be preying upon grasshoppers.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse not only found this species abundant in Texas, in the
vicinity of San Antonio, but in the Indian Territory also it was quite common,
particularly near the Cross Timbers. He found them breeding in the
beginning of the month of July, on the Great Prairie. Its nest was built
on the horizontal branch of a small scrub-oak, about six feet from the
ground, and was composed of coarse dry grass and sticks. It contained
four young birds nearly able to fly. On his approach the female flew from
the nest to a bush near by. The male bird flew to a great height above
him, circling round in the air, apparently watching his movements, and at
the same time uttering a coarse scolding chirp.</p>

<p>Dr. Gideon Lincecum, of Texas, writes that the Scissor-tail Flycatchers
have greatly increased in numbers in that State since 1848. They are
severe hunters of insects, and make great havoc among honey-bees. They
are exclusively prairie birds. He adds that they construct their nests far out
on the top branches of the live-oak or any other lone tree on the prairies.
They seem to be a very playful bird, and delight in shooting rapidly upwards,
cutting the air with their strong wings with such force that the sound
may be heard to the distance of three hundred yards or more. Their notes
are harsh and inharmonious. They leave Texas late in autumn, and return
<!--356.png--><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 314]</span>
again about the first of April. The resounding strokes of their wings and
their oft-repeated cries are heard just before the dawn of day. They usually
have but three eggs.</p>

<p>A single individual of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Milvulus</i>, and supposed to be one of this species,
was seen by Mr. C. Drexler, May 6, 1861, but was not obtained, in the
vicinity of Washington. Another bird of this species is mentioned by Mr.
Abbott as having been taken near Trenton, <abbr title="New Jersey">N. J.</abbr>, April 15, 1872. It was a
male bird in full health and feather. Its stomach was found to be full of
small coleoptera, insects’ eggs, flies, etc.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species vary greatly in size, from .92 by .75 to .80 by .60
of an inch. They are in shape a rounded oval, and tapering at one end.
The ground-color is white, marked with a few very large dark red spots,
and occasionally of an obscure purple.</p>

Tail nearly even, or moderately forked; rather shorter than the wings;
the feathers broad, and widening
somewhat at the ends.
Wings long and pointed; the
outer primaries rather abruptly
attenuated near the end, the
attenuated portion not linear,
however. Head with a concealed
patch of red on the
crown.</p>

<p>The species of this
genus are especially characterized
by their long,
attenuated primaries, their
moderately forked or
nearly even tail, and the
concealed colored crest in
the crown. Their affinities
are nearest to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Milvulus</i>, from which the tail, shorter than the wings,
instead of twice as long, or more, will always serve as a point of distinction.
The attenuation of the primary differs in being less abrupt, and not truly
linear, sloping gradually, and not bounded behind by a notch. We are
unable to appreciate any other differences of importance.</p>

<p>The character and extent of the attenuation of the primaries, the depth
of the fork of the tail, with the size of the legs and bill, all vary considerably,
and may, perhaps, serve as ground for further subdivisions. The bill, in
particular, varies much in size in the North American species, from that of

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Kingbird or Bee Martin of North America is
found throughout the continent, from Texas and Florida, on the south, as far
to the north as the 57th parallel of north latitude. Westward, north of the
44th parallel, it is found from the Atlantic to the Pacific, but south of this
it has not been found west of the Rocky Mountains. It is included by Dr.
Cooper among the birds of California, but I am not aware that it has ever
been taken within the limits of that State. Mr. Allen regards the eastern
slope of the Rocky Mountains its extreme western limit; but Mr. Ridgway
states that this species was met with by him in various portions of the
Great Basin, though always in less abundance than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. verticalis</i>. Among
the cottonwoods of the Truckee Valley, in Western Nevada, two or three
pairs were seen in July and August. In the fertile Salt Lake Valley it was
nearly or quite as common as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. verticalis</i>, and was also met with in the
fertile “parks” of the Wahsatch Mountains.</p>

<p>This species not only has this widely extended area, but is also quite
abundant wherever found. It is apparently as abundant throughout Nova
Scotia as it is in the State of Florida. Richardson even found it common on
the banks of the Saskatchewan, where he traced its northern migrations
beyond the 57th parallel of latitude. It was found at the Carlton House
early in May, and retired southward in September. It winters in Central
and South America, and has been received by Mr. Lawrence from Panama.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley found this species quite plentiful at the eastern base of the
Rocky Mountains, in Washington Territory, and more sparingly at Puget
Sound, where he obtained several specimens. They appeared to shun the
dense forests near Puget Sound, but were moderately plentiful in the groves
of low oaks, and among the cottonwood-trees fringing the lakes on Nisqually
Plains, where, August 5, he obtained a nest with newly fledged young.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Leyland found this species near Omoa, in Honduras, migratory.
They came in flocks of two or three hundred, but remained only a
short time before departing farther south. They flew high, and seemed very
wild. This species was also met with, in May, at Playa Vicente, in the low
lands of the State of Oaxaca, Mexico, by Mr. Boucard, and during the winter
months is found throughout Mexico.</p>

<p>No one of our common birds possesses more strongly marked characteristics
of manners and habits than this species. Its pugnacious disposition
during the breeding-season, the audacious boldness with which it will attack
any birds larger than itself, the persistent tenacity with which it will continue
these attacks, and the reckless courage with which it will maintain its
unequal warfare, are well-known peculiarities of this interesting and familiar
species. Its name, Kingbird, is given it on the supposition that it is superior
<!--360.png--><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 318]</span>
to all other birds in these contests. My own observations lead me to
the conclusion that writers have somewhat exaggerated the quarrelsome disposition
of this bird. I have never, or very rarely, known it to molest or
attack any other birds than those which its own instinct prompts it to drive
away in self-defence, such as Hawks, Owls, Eagles, Crows, Jays, Cuckoos, and
Grakles. These it will always attack and drive off to quite a distance from
their nests. Nothing can be more striking than the intrepidity with which
one of these birds will pounce upon and harass birds vastly larger and more
powerful than itself. The Kingbird is always <a name="note18" id="note18"></a>prompt to perceive the approach
of one of these enemies, and always rushes out to meet it. Mounting
in the air high above, it pounces down upon its back, upon which it will
even rest, furiously pecking at the exposed flanks of its victim, and only
leaving it to descend again and again with the same unrelenting animosity.
In these encounters it always comes off conqueror.</p>

<p>Wilson states that his jealous affection for his mate and for his nest and
young makes him suspicious of every bird that happens to pass near his residence.
But this is not the case in all instances. A pair of these birds
nested, in the summer of 1871, and peacefully reared their young, in an
apple-tree near my residence, within four feet of the nest of the Baltimore
Oriole, and not more than eight or ten feet from the nest of a Robin, all
in the same tree. The three pairs were on evident terms of amity and
mutual good-will. The male Kingbird kept a sharp lookout for danger
from the topmost bough, and seemed to have all under his special guardianship,
but showed no disposition to molest or annoy them.</p>

<p>The Purple Martin is said to be the implacable enemy of the Kingbird, and
one of the few birds with which the latter maintains an unequal contest.
Its superiority in flight gives the former great advantages, while its equal
courage and strength render it more than a match. Audubon relates an
instance in which the Kingbird was slain in one of these struggles.</p>

<p>Wilson also narrates an encounter, of which he was an eyewitness, between
one of this species and a Red-headed Woodpecker, in which the latter,
while clinging on the rail of a fence, seemed to amuse itself with the violence
of the Kingbird, playing bo-peep with it round the rail, while the
latter became greatly irritated, and made repeated but vain attempts to strike
at him.</p>

<p>The Kingbird feeds almost exclusively upon winged insects, and consumes
a vast number. It is on this account one of our most useful birds, but,
unfortunately for its popularity, it is no respecter of kinds, and destroys
large numbers of bees. In districts where hives of honey-bees abound, the
Kingbird is not in good repute. Wilson suggests that they only destroy the
drones, and rarely, if ever, meddle with the working bees. But this discrimination,
even if real, is not appreciated by the raisers of bees, who
regard this bird as their enemy.</p>

<p>The Kingbirds arrive in Pennsylvania the latter part of April, and in New
<!--361.png--><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 319]</span>
England early in May, and leave for the South in September. They nest
in May, selecting an upper branch, usually of an isolated tree, and often in
an exposed situation. Their nests are large, broad, and comparatively shallow,
and coarsely, though strongly, made of rude materials, such as twigs,
withered plants, bits of rags, strings, etc. These are lined with fine rootlets,
horse-hair, and fine grasses.</p>

<p>The Kingbird has no song, but, instead, utters an incessant monotonous
succession of twitterings, which vary in sharpness and loudness with the
emotions that prompt them.</p>

<p>The flight of the Kingbird when on the hunt for insects is peculiar and
characteristic. It flies slowly over the field, with rapid vibrations of the
wings, in the manner of Hawks, and soars or seems to float in the air in
a manner equally similar. At other times it flies with great rapidity, and
dives about in the air in the manner of a Swallow. It also exhibits great
power and rapidity of flight when rushing forth to encounter a Hawk or
an Eagle.</p>

<p>As they are known occasionally to plunge into the water, and, emerging
thence, to resume their seat on a high branch, to dry and dress their plumage,
it has been conjectured that they feed on small fish, but this is unsupported
by any positive evidence.</p>

<p>Though the Kingbird usually builds in trees, it does not always select such
situations. In the summer of 1851, passing over a bridge near the village
of Aylesford, in Nova Scotia, I observed a Kingbird fly from a nest built on
the projecting end of one of the planks of which the bridge was made. So
remarkably exposed a position, open to view, and on a level with and within
a few feet of a highway, must be quite unusual.</p>

<p>The eggs of this bird are five, sometimes six, in number, and vary considerably
in size. Their ground-color is white with a more or less decided
roseate tinge, beautifully spotted with blotches and markings of purple,
brown, and red-brown. In some, these are disposed in a confluent crown
around the larger end; in others they are irregularly distributed over the
entire egg. In length they vary from 1.05 to .86 of an inch, and in breadth
from .72 to .70 of an inch.</p>

<p>Specimens from Nicaragua and New Granada appear to be almost perfectly

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Gray Kingbird&mdash;the Pipiry Flycatcher of Audubon, or Gray
Petchary of Jamaica&mdash;is, except in Florida, of scarcely more than occasional
occurrence within the limits of the United States. A single specimen has been
taken in Massachusetts. This was shot in Lynn, October 23, 1868, and was
in immature plumage. The bird was shot on a tree near one of the streets
of that city by Mr. Charles Goodall. Mr. Audubon also found these birds
quite common on the Florida Keys, almost every Key, however small, having
its pair. A pair was observed breeding in the college yard at Charleston,
<abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr>, by Dr. Bachman; and for at least three years in succession they regularly
returned each year, and raised two broods in a season. This Flycatcher
is abundant in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix, Cuba, Jamaica, and in the other West India Islands.
In the first-named locality Mr. Alfred Newton found it one of the
most conspicuous and commonest birds over the entire island. Its favorite
station, he states, was the top of the spearlike unexpanded frond of a tall
<!--363.png--><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 321]</span>
mountain-cabbage tree, from which place, in the breeding-season, it darted
down to attack almost any animal that passed near. Its favorite object of
attack was the Green Heron (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Butorides virescens</i>), at which it would make
several well-directed swoops, never leaving it until it had driven it into some
shelter, when, much pleased with its prowess, it would return to its lookout
station and celebrate its victory with cries of triumph. On one occasion
Mr. Newton observed a Gray Kingbird pursue a Green Heron out to sea
for a quarter of a mile and back. It is described as a very clamorous bird,
even when there is apparently no need; taking alarm from the domestic
poultry, its oft-repeated notes were heard every morning before the dawn.
This noise it continued pertinaciously till sundown. Its food consists of
insects, which are caught with great dexterity on the wing. It also feeds
very largely on the black berries of a myrtle-leaved parasite that grows
abundantly on the orange-trees. The nest is often placed under the fronds
or among the spathes of a cocoanut or mountain-cabbage tree, and sometimes
in any ordinary situation. It is described as flat in construction and large
for the size of the bird, being nearly a foot in diameter, composed of a platform
of twigs, in the midst of which is hollowed a cup lined with fine roots.
In <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix the eggs rarely exceeded three in number, and are spoken of as
exceedingly beautiful when fresh, of a delicate creamy white, marked at the
larger end with blotches and spots of pink or orange-brown, often disposed
in a zone. He found their eggs from May till August.</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Hill, of Spanishtown, Jamaica, in some interesting notes furnished
to Mr. Gosse, states that along the seaside savannas of that island
migrant flocks of these birds swarm early in September. Numbers then
congregate on the trees around the cattle ponds and about the open meadows,
pursuing the swarms of insects which fill the air at sundown. These
throngs are immediately joined by resident birds of this species, which
gather about the same places, and do not return to their usual abodes until
the breeding-season is at hand.</p>

<p>The Jamaica bird is not exclusively an insect-feeder, but eats very freely
of the sweet wild berries, especially those of the pimento. These ripen in
September, and in groves of these this bird may always be found in
abundance. By the end of September most of the migrant birds have left
the island.</p>

<p>This is among the earliest to breed of the birds of Jamaica. As early as
January the mated pair is said to be in possession of some lofty tree,
sounding at day-dawn a ceaseless shriek, which is composed of a repetition
of three or four notes, sounding like <i class="birdcall">pē-chēē-ry</i>, according to Mr. Hill, and
from which they derive their local name. In these localities they remain
until autumn, when they quit these haunts and again congregate about the
lowland ponds. In feeding, just before sunset, they usually sit, eight or ten
in a row, on some exposed twig, darting from it in pursuit of their prey, and
returning to it to devour whatever they have caught. They are rapid in
<!--364.png--><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 322]</span>
their movements, ever constantly and hurriedly changing their positions in
flight. As they fly, they are able to check their speed suddenly, and to turn
at the smallest imaginable angle. At times they move off in a straight
line, gliding with motionless wings from one tree to another. When one descends
to pick an insect from the surface of the water, it has the appearance
of tumbling, and, in rising again, ascends with a singular motion of the wings,
as if hurled into the air and endeavoring to recover itself.</p>

<p>In the manner in which the male of this species will perch on the top of
some lofty tree, and from that vantage-height scream defiance to all around
him, and pursue any large bird that approaches, as described by Mr. Hill,
all the audacity and courage of our Kingbird is exhibited. At the approach
of a Vulture or a Hawk, he starts off in a horizontal line, after rising in
the air to the same height as his adversary, and, hovering over him for
a moment, descends upon the intruder’s back, rising and sinking as he
repeats his attack, and shrieking all the while. In these attacks he is
always triumphant.</p>

<p>This Flycatcher is also charged by Mr. Hill with seizing upon the Humming-Birds
as they hover over the blossoms in the garden, killing its prey
by repeated blows struck on the branch, and then devouring them.</p>

<p>The nest, according to Mr. Hill, is seldom found in any other tree than
that of the palm kind. Among the web of fibres around the footstalk of
each branch the nest is woven of cotton-wool and grass. The eggs, he adds,
are four or five, of an ivory color, blotched with deep purple spots, intermingled
with brown specks, the clusters thickening at the greater end. Mr.
Gosse, on the contrary, never found the nest in a palm. One, taken from
an upper limb of a bitterwood-tree that grew close to a friend’s door, at no
great height, was a cup made of the stalks and tendrils of a small passion
flower, the spiral tendrils very prettily arranged around the edge, and very
neatly and thickly lined with black horse-hair. The other, made in a spondias
bush, was a rather loose structure, smaller and less compact, almost entirely
composed of tendrils, with no horse-hair, but a few shining black frond-ribs
of a fern.</p>

<p>Mr. March states that the migrant birds of this species return to Jamaica
about the last of March, gradually disperse, and, like the resident birds, occupy
their selected trees in solitary pairs, and immediately set about preparing
their nests. At <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Catharine’s the first nest found was on the 14th of
April, and the latest in the middle of July. They seldom build in the tree
in which they perch, but select a lower tree near it. Some make their nests
high, others low, usually at the extremity of a lateral branch. He describes
them as loose structures of twigs and the stems of trailing plants, with the
cup of grass, horse-hair, and vegetable fibre. The eggs are three, rarely
four, of a long oval, with a ground of light cream-color, dashed around the
larger end more or less thickly with blotches of burnt sienna, and with
cloudings of pale bistre underneath.</p>

<p><!--365.png--><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 323]</span>
Mr. Audubon states that this Flycatcher reaches the Florida Keys about
the first of April. He describes their usual flight as performed by a constant
flutter of the wings, except when in chase, when they exhibit considerable
power and speed. He noticed them pursue larger birds, such as
Herons, Crows, Cuckoos, Grakles, and Hawks, following them quite a distance.
They did not molest the Doves. They built their nests in a manner
similar to the Kingbird, on the horizontal branches of the mangrove, almost
invariably on the western side of the tree and of the island. Some were not
more than two feet above the water, others were twenty feet. On one of the
keys, although of small size, he saw several of their nests, and more than
a dozen of the birds living amicably together.</p>

<p>Dr. J. G. Cooper, who visited Florida in the spring of 1859, informed me,
by letter, on his return, that when he reached Cape Florida, March 8, none
of this species were to be seen on any of the keys. The first he noticed were
about the first of May, near Fort Dallas on the mainland. As, however, it
rarely appears at this place, he supposes they reached the keys some weeks
sooner. About May 14 he found several pairs at the Cape, and, going up
the coast to New Smyrna, he found them abundant about the marshy islands.
On the first of June, with a companion, he went in a small boat for the express
purpose of finding their nests; and, pushing the boat about among the
islands which almost filled Mosquito Lagoon, he discovered three in one afternoon.
They were all built among the small branches of low dead mangrove-trees,
about ten feet from the ground, formed of a loose, open flooring of
small twigs, with scarcely any lining of a finer material. One contained four
eggs half hatched, another three young and one egg, the third four young
just hatched. He preserved one nest and all the eggs, and presented them
to the National Museum in Washington. The old birds showed no resentment,
and neither came near nor followed him, differing very much in this
respect from the fearless and devoted Kingbird. The only notes this bird
was heard to utter were loud and harsh rattling cries. Dr. Bachman informed
Dr. Cooper that these birds had become quite regular summer visitants
of Charleston, where they continued to breed each season. Dr. Cooper
saw none away from the Florida coast, and thinks that none go inland.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species measure from 1 to 1.05 inches in length, and from
.70 to .72 of an inch in breadth. They are of an oblong oval shape, variously
marked with large blotches and smaller spots of purple, red-brown,
and a dark purplish-brown. The latter color, in a few cases, is found in
large masses, covering nearly a fifth of the entire surface of the egg; not
inaptly compared by Mr. Gosse to the sinuous outlines of lands, as represented
on a terrestrial globe.</p>

The four exterior quills attenuated very gently at the end, the first most
so; third and fourth quills longest, second and fifth successively a little shorter. Tail
slightly forked; bill shorter than the head. Crown, sides of head above the eyes, nape,

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Western North America, from the high Central Plains to the Pacific; Colima,
Mexico. Accidental in Eastern States (New Jersey, <span class="sc">Turnbull</span>; Plymton, Maine, <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr>
1865, <span class="sc">Bryant</span>, <abbr title="Proceedings Boston Society Ten">Pr. Bost. Soc., X</abbr>, 1865, 96).</p>

<p>The young bird is, in general, quite similar, with the exception of the
usual appearance of immaturity, the colored patch on the crown wanting.
In one specimen the first primary only is attenuated, in others none exhibit
this character.</p>

<p>A specimen of this bird, shot at Moorestown, <abbr title="New Jersey">N. J.</abbr>, is in the museum
of the Philadelphia Academy, but this locality can only be considered as
very exceptional.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Arkansas Flycatcher was first discovered by the party in
Long’s Expedition in 1823, and described by Mr. Say. It is a bird of western
North America, found from the great plains to the Pacific, and only accidentally
occurring east. A single specimen is said to have been shot in
Moorestown, <abbr title="New Jersey">N. J.</abbr>, near Philadelphia. It has been met with in Texas as far
east as the river Mimbres, and in Nebraska nearly to the Missouri River.
The specimen from which the first description was made was obtained in the
beginning of July, near the Platte River.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall, in his Western tour, first met with this species early in July,
among the scanty wood on the banks of the northwest branch of the Platte
River. He characterizes it as a bold and querulous bird. He found it
<!--367.png--><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 325]</span>
all the way from thence to the forests of the Columbia and the Wahlamet,
and throughout California to latitude 32<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. He speaks of them as remarkably
noisy and quarrelsome with each other, and, like the Kingbird, suffering
nothing of the bird kind to approach them without exhibiting their predilection
for dispute. He describes their note as a discordant, clicking warble,
resembling <i class="birdcall">tsh’k-tsh’k-tshivait</i>,&mdash;sounding not unlike the creaking of a rusty
door-hinge, something in the manner of a Kingbird, with a blending of the
notes of the common Purple Grakle.</p>

<p>Mr. Townsend mentions finding this bird numerous along the banks of
the Platte, particularly in the vicinity of trees. From that river to the
banks of the Columbia, and as far as the ocean, it was a very common
species. The males were wonderfully belligerent, fighting almost constantly
and with great fury.</p>

<p>Dr. J. G. Cooper states that in California this is an abundant species,
arriving in that State about the 20th of March. None are known to remain
within the State during the winter. Small parties of males come first, and
are very quarrelsome until each one has selected its mate. This is not done
for several weeks, and the earliest nest with eggs that he has found was on
the 12th of May at Santa Barbara. The nest, built on a branch of a low oak
near the town, was five inches wide, constructed of lichens, twigs, coarse
grass, and wool, lined with hair. It contained four eggs, measuring .94 by
.70 of an inch. He describes them as creamy-white, spotted with purple of
two shades near the larger end.</p>

<p>These birds are said to be almost an exact counterpart of the Kingbird,
exhibiting the same courage in defence of their nests. Their notes are more
varied and noisy, and they utter them almost constantly during the spring,
often when flying and fighting. They are very destructive to bees, but compensate
for this damage by destroying great quantities of noxious insects.
They leave the State in October. At Puget Sound, early in June, Dr. Cooper
found this species associating with the common Kingbird without any signs
of disagreement, though their similar habits would naturally lead to disputes.
He has even seen them together in parties of four about the period of mating.
They do not approach the coast in Washington Territory.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley found this species abundant in the central and western portions
of Oregon and Washington Territory. He first noted their arrival from
the South about May 15. The first notification of their presence is given
by the skirmishes and quarrels incident to the love-season. Their battles
are generally fought in the air, and present ludicrous alternations of pursuit
and flight. At Fort Dalles their favorite breeding-places were oak-trees for
the most part.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles D. Gibbes, of Stockton, informs us that these birds occasionally
build their nests in the shrubbery about the gardens, but more frequently
in large oak-trees, fifteen or twenty feet from the ground. They are constructed
of weeds and grass firmly woven together, and lined with cotton,
<!--368.png--><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 326]</span>
feathers, strings, and other soft materials. They are usually secured to the
limb on which they are placed by a portion of the string. The diameter of
the cavity of the nest is about three inches, depth one and a half. Their
eggs are laid in May and June, and are four, five, or six in number. They
are described as white, marked with dark brown spots on the larger end.
In some the spots, decreasing in size, extend to the smaller end.</p>

<p>Dr. Hoy informs me that he has never detected this bird within the limits
of Wisconsin, though he has no doubt that they may occasionally straggle
into its limits, as have many of the birds peculiar to the Missouri region.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway gives it as one of the most abundant and familiar of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyrannidæ</i> in the Sacramento Valley and the fertile portions of the
Great Basin. He notes their excessively quarrelsome disposition, which far
exceeds that of the eastern Kingbird, for fighting among themselves seems
to be their chief amusement. As many as half a dozen of these birds were
sometimes noticed pitching at one another promiscuously, in their playful
combats; and when a nest was disturbed, the cries of the parents invariably
brought to the vicinity all the birds of this species in the neighborhood,
which, as soon as gathered together, began their aerial battles by attacking
each other without regard apparently to individuals, accompanying the fight
by a shrill twitter, very different from the loud rattling notes of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. carolinensis</i>.
Indeed, all the notes of the western Kingbird are very conspicuously
different from those of the eastern species, being weaker, and more twittering
in their character. The nesting habits, the construction of the nest, and
appearance of the eggs, are, however, almost perfectly identical.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway gives an interesting account (<abbr title="American Naturalist, August">Am. Nat., Aug.</abbr>, 1869) of a
young bird of this species which became quite domesticated with his party
in the geological survey of the 40th parallel. It had been taken about the
middle of July, fully fledged, from the nest, by some Indians, and was fed
with grasshoppers and flies until able to catch them for itself. When not
in quest of food it remained quietly perched on Mr. Ridgway’s shoulder or
his hat, or would perch on a rope extending from the top of the tent to a
stake. At night it frequently roosted under an umbrella which hung outside
of the tent. If permitted, it would have preferred to keep on its master’s
shoulder, snuggling against his neck. In the morning it was sure to come
fluttering about his head, singling him out from a dozen or more persons who
lay around upon the ground. It had an insatiable appetite, and was ascertained
by actual count to consume one hundred and twenty fat grasshoppers
in a day. It soon learned its own name, Chippy, and always answered to
the call. It followed Mr. Ridgway when on horseback, occasionally leaving
to sport with other birds, but always returning to his shoulder or hat. It
evidently preferred the society of the camp to that of his own race. It
was once, by accident, nearly shot, and ever after held the gun in great dread.
It went with Mr. Ridgway from camp to camp, continuing perfectly tame
and domesticated, until, as was supposed, it fell a prey to a Hawk.</p>

<p><!--369.png--><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 327]</span>
The eggs of this species are not easily distinguishable from those of the
common Kingbird. They have a ground-color of a crystalline whiteness,
marked with bold dashes of reddish and purplish brown, the latter fewer
and faint. They are oblong in shape, are pointed at one end, and measure
1 inch in length by .70 of an inch in breadth.</p>

Bill from the forehead about as long as the head. Tail even or slightly
rounded. Outer five primaries attenuated; the first four abruptly and deeply emarginated;
third quill longest, second and fourth a little less, first shorter than the sixth, and
half an inch less than the longest. Head and neck above and on the sides rather dark
bluish-ash; the throat and breast similar, and only a little paler. Rest of upper parts
olive-green tinged with gray, mixed with brown on the rump; the upper tail-coverts and
surface of the tail nearly black; the outer web of the external feather and the tips of all
pale brown. The chin is white, in strong contrast to the dark ash of the throat; the
rest of the under parts bright sulphur-yellow (the sides olivaceous), palest on the under
tail-coverts and inside of wing. A concealed vermilion patch in the crown, bordered by
straw-yellow. Wing-feathers brown, tinged with olive, becoming paler towards the edge.

<p>The table of specific characters presented under the generic head will
readily serve to distinguish this species from its near ally, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. verticalis</i>. The
white outer web of the exterior tail-feather in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">verticalis</i>, compared with the
brown web, only edged with whitish of the present bird, is always sufficient
to separate them; while the deep ash of the jugulum, and the much lighter,
more brownish shade of the wings, are entirely peculiar features.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This bird is abundant in Vera Cruz, where it is known by the
name of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Portuguéz</i>. According to Sumichrast, it belongs to the hot and
temperate regions, rather than the alpine. It is also common in the Plateau,
and is found in all parts of Mexico.</p>

<p>In Arizona Dr. Coues states this bird to be an abundant summer resident,
arriving in that Territory during the third week in April, and remaining
until the latter part of September. It was found in every kind of locality.
He furnishes no information as to its habits.</p>

<p>During the Mexican Boundary Survey this species was taken on the
<!--370.png--><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 328]</span>
Colorado River, in California, by Dr. A. Schott, and at Los Nogales, Mexico,
by Dr. Kennerly. It was also met with in the Sacramento Valley by Dr.
Heermann; at Fort Thorn, New Mexico, by Dr. Henry; on the Pecos,
Texas, by Captain Pope; and specimens from Mexico have been received
from Mr. Gould. It does not appear to have been observed in Southwestern
Texas by Mr. Dresser.</p>

<p>This species Dr. Cooper states to be quite common throughout the southern
half of California, and resident throughout the year at least as far north
as Los Angeles. In color they greatly resemble the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. verticalis</i>, but are
less lively and not so quarrelsome in their habits. During the early part of
the year they begin to sing by daylight, generally from the top of some high
tree. Their notes are said to be loud and much more musical than those of
the other species, and their song exhibits considerable variety for a bird of
this family. During the middle of the day they are rather quiet, and sit
much of the time on their perch, occasionally catching an insect that comes
very near, but they are supposed by Dr. Cooper to feed mostly in the very
early morning. This observer found them breeding at San Diego as early
as March 28, as well as subsequently. Their nest is said to be much larger
and more firmly built than are those of others of the genus, being five and
a half inches in external diameter and about two and a half in height. The
cavity is three inches wide at the rim. The eggs, which he describes as
white, with large scattered reddish-brown and umber blotches, measure .96
of an inch in length and .70 in breadth. He found some of these birds in
Santa Clara Valley in May, 1864. They appeared to be smaller and greener
on the back than those from the South. They winter in large numbers at
Santa Clara, in latitude 37<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>.

Dr. Coues found this a very abundant summer resident at Fort Whipple,
breeding there in considerable numbers, and all leaving early in October.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway did not meet with this species anywhere in the Great Basin,
nor in the Sacramento Valley. On the plains it is found as far north as
Cheyenne and Laramie Peak, and in the southern portion of the Western
Provinces extends westward to California.</p>

<p>Specimens were obtained by Mr. George M. Skinner from Salamá, Vera
Paz, in Central America. It was also taken, in February, near Oaxaca,
Mexico, by Mr. Boucard.</p>

<p>A nest of this bird (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1,828), in the Smithsonian Museum, was taken at
Volcan de Colima, June, 1863, by Mr. John Xantus. It is a slight structure
composed chiefly of wiry grass, mixed with bits of wool, and lined with
finer grasses. The eggs are two in number, having a pure-white ground,
freckled on the larger end with purplish-brown and grayish-lilac. These
markings are more sparse and are finer than those of the eggs of any other
species of this genus, so far as I am aware. One of the eggs has a few
blotches of umber on the larger end. They measure, one .93 by .68 of an
inch, the other .93 by .65.</p>

considerably forked (depth of fork about .30 of an inch, or more). Head, neck, and
jugulum bluish-ashy, becoming nearly white on the throat, and shaded with yellow on
the breast. Rest of lower parts gamboge-yellow. Rest of upper parts olive-green,
tinged with ash anteriorly. Tail and primaries grayish-brown, the tail not the darker.
Wing-coverts passing externally into pale, the tertials edged with almost white. Crown
with a concealed patch of bright orange-red. Length, 9.00; wing, 5.00; tail, 4.70.</p>

Middle America (both coasts), from southern border of United States, south to
Guatemala; Tucson, Arizona (<span class="sc">Bendire</span>).</p>

<p>All specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. melancholicus</i> from regions north of Guatemala are

<p>It is only by comparing specimens from near the extreme northern and
southern limits of the range of the species, that differences are readily discernible;
and between these two extremes there is so gradual a transition that
it is impossible to draw a line separating two well-marked varieties, so that it
is necessary to assume an arbitrary geographical line, and determine specimens
from the middle regions by their position, whether to the north or
south of the line established. Specimens from Buenos Ayres, the Parana,
and Brazil, to Peru and New Granada, are identical. Costa Rica specimens
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. satrapa</i>, <abbr title="Lichtenstein"><span class="sc">Licht.</span></abbr>) have the dark tail of <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melancholicus</i> and white throat

Tarsus equal to or not longer than the middle toe, which is decidedly
longer than the hinder one. Bill wider at base than half the culmen. Tail broad, long,
even, or slightly rounded, about equal to the wings, which scarcely reach the middle of the
tail; the first primary shorter than the sixth. Head with elongated lanceolate distinct
feathers. Above brownish-olive, throat ash, belly yellow. Tail and wing feathers varied

<p>This genus is well marked among the American Flycatchers, and constitutes
what Bonaparte called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ultimi Tyrannorum sive Tyrannularum primæ</i>.
The type is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Muscicapa ferox</i> of Gmelin, (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. tyrannulus</i>,) which, as identified
by Cabanis and Burmeister as above, appears to resemble our species

<p>For an elaborate discussion of the various forms of this exceedingly difficult
<!--372.png--><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 330]</span>
genus, we are indebted to a recent monograph by Dr. Coues, in the
Proceedings of the
Philadelphia Academy,
for June and
July, 1872 (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 56-81).
With the same
material for our investigations,
we have
been led, after a very
careful perusal of the
valuable paper mentioned,
and tedious
critical comparison
of the large material
at our command, to
adopt a somewhat
difficult view of the
relationship of the forms characterized. The following synopsis expresses
their affinity as at present understood:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="comchar"><span class="sc">Common Characters.</span> Above olivaceous, usually uniform, sometimes darker,
sometimes more ashy, on the head above. Head and jugulum more or less ashy,

more or less edged on either web with rufous; but sometimes entirely destitute
of this color.</p>

<span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Great-crested Flycatcher of eastern North America
has a much more extended northern distribution than has been generally
given it by earlier writers. Wilson speaks of it only as a bird of Pennsylvania.
Audubon mentions their occurring as far as Massachusetts, but as
confined to the mountains, and as entirely unknown farther eastward. Mr.
Nuttall refers to it as nearly unknown in New England, and as never
appearing near the coast.</p>

<p>It is now known to be a regular though a somewhat rare summer resident,
at least as far to the northeast as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen, New Brunswick, latitude 45<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>
north, longitude 67<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> west, and as far to the north in Vermont as Randolph,
and Hamilton in Canada, both in about latitude 44<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. Mr. Boardman mentions
it as a regular summer visitant, and as breeding near Calais. Professor
Verrill gives it as a rare summer visitant of Western Maine. Mr.
McIlwraith states it to be a common summer resident of Hamilton, Canada
West, where it arrives about the 10th of May, after which its harsh cry
is heard in all parts of the woods. It winters in Central America and
Panama.</p>

<p>In a letter dated June 17, 1865, Mr. C. S. Paine of Randolph, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, informed
me that he had, within a few days, found a nest of this Flycatcher.
It was built in the hollow of a decayed apple-tree, in one of its limbs. The
nest was built up from the bottom of the cavity some eight inches, and contained
six eggs. Though not very abundant in that neighborhood, Mr. Paine
had been aware, for several years, of the occurrence of this Flycatcher, but
had never before been able to ascertain its manner of nesting. He has
since informed me that these Flycatchers have continued to occur every
summer, as they always make their presence known by their harsh notes,
which may be heard to quite a distance, and he knows that they breed there
regularly every year. They are shy, and do not come about the buildings,
but are generally seen in the woods and orchards.</p>

<p>In Eastern Massachusetts they are not common, but scattered pairs have
been met with in Concord, Acton, Newton, Hingham, and in other places.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues states that the Great-crested Flycatcher reaches Washington
the third week in April, and leaves the last of September. It is a common
summer resident, but is most numerous in the spring and autumn. It is
found on the edge of open woods, and betrays its presence by its peculiar
notes. In the western part of Massachusetts, Mr. Allen gives it as a rare
summer visitant, having been taken by him from May 15 to September 17,
and having been found breeding on Mount Tom by Mr. C. W. Bennett.
It is found abundantly in the Middle and Southern States as far south as
Florida and Texas, and occurs as far to the west as the Missouri River.
Dr. Woodhouse found it very abundant in Texas and in the Indian Territory,
and Mr. Dresser obtained specimens at San Antonio in the month of
April.</p>

<p>In speaking of the habits of this species, Wilson accuses it of being
<!--378.png--><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 336]</span>
addicted to eating bees equally with the Kingbird; but as this bird is known
to feed largely on berries, and to feed its young to some extent with the
same, the extent of such propensity may well be doubted. It is not so prone
to attack birds larger than itself as is the Kingbird, which Wilson characterizes
as cowardice, but which it would be more charitable to call prudence.
It is said to be harsh, cruel, and vindictive to smaller birds and to weaker
individuals of its own species.</p>

<p>In its flight it moves with power, steadiness, and swiftness, and when in
pursuit of insects follows its prey with great zeal and perseverance. When
it captures a large insect, it retires to its perch and beats it against the
limb. These birds are not in the least gregarious. They occur in isolated
pairs, and appear to have no interest or sympathy with others than those of
their own household. To each other, however, they are attentive and considerate,
and they are devoted in their solicitude for their young.</p>

<p>Their usual call-note is a sharp disagreeable squeak, which, once known, is
easily recognized. Besides this it has a monotonous succession of squeaking,
harsh notes, only a little less unpleasant. They raise but one brood in
a season, and remain together in a family group of from six to eight until
they leave, in the middle of September.</p>

<p>During the early summer this species feeds chiefly upon insects of various
kinds, which it catches with great facility, skill, and assiduity; afterwards, as
if from choice, it chiefly eats ripe berries of various kinds of shrubs and
plants, among which those of the poke-weed and the huckleberry are most
noticeable. It nests altogether in hollows in trees, stumps, or limbs. It
lines the bottoms of these hollows with a great variety of miscellaneous
materials, and in quantities that vary with the size and shape of the place to
be occupied. These beds are composed of loose hay, feathers, the hair of
various small quadrupeds, etc., while the exuviæ of snakes are almost always
to be met with.</p>

<p>The eggs, four, five, or six in number, are peculiar and noticeably varied
and beautiful in their style of markings, varying also somewhat in shape.
Generally they are nearly spherical, and equally obtuse at either end.
Occasionally they are an oblong oval, one end a very little more tapering
than the other. Their ground-color is a beautiful light buff, rather than a
cream-color, over which are waving lines, marblings, markings, and dots of a
brilliant purple, and others of a more obscure shading. The lines are
variously distributed, generally running from one pole of the egg to the
other with striking effect, as if laid on with the delicate brush of an artist.
In some eggs the whole surface is so closely covered with these intercrossing
and waving lines, blending with the obscure cloudings of lilac, as nearly to
conceal the ground. Usually the buff color is conspicuously apparent, and
sets off the purple lines with great effect.</p>

<p>An oblong-oval egg from New Jersey measures 1.10 inches in length by
.70 of an inch in breadth. A more nearly spherical egg from Florida measures
<!--379.png--><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 337]</span>
.90 by .75 of an inch. These well represent the two extremes. Their
average is about 1 inch by .75 of an inch.</p>

<p>The eggs of all the members of this genus have a remarkable similarity,
and can scarcely be mistaken for those of any other group.</p>

<p>In a young specimen the crown is more tinged with brown; the upper
tail-coverts and the middle tail-feathers are chestnut, and, in fact, all the
tail-feathers are of this color, except along both sides of the shaft on the
central feathers, and along its outer side in the lateral ones.</p>

<p>This species is easily distinguished from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. crinitus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. cooperi</i> by
the brown tip of the tail; the colors paler than in the former, bill slenderer,
and tarsi longer.</p>

<p>A variety of this species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pertinax</i><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_78" id="fnanchor_78"></a><a href="#footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></span>)
is found at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, and distinguished

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Ash-throated or Mexican Flycatcher appears to be a common
species, from San Antonio, Texas, its extreme northeastern point, southwesterly
throughout Mexico as far south as Guatemala, and westward to
the Pacific coast. It has been obtained in various parts of California
by Mr. Cutts, Mr. Schott, Dr. Heermann, and others, as also on the Gila
<!--380.png--><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 338]</span>
River. Dr. Kennerly procured specimens at Los Nogales, Mexico, and
others have met with it near the city of Mexico, at Saltillo, and in different
parts of Western Texas. It was found breeding at Cape San Lucas by Mr.
Xantus.</p>

<p>In the Department of Vera Cruz, Mr. Sumichrast found this species apparently
confined to the hot region. He did not meet with it anywhere else.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser thinks that this Flycatcher does not reach San Antonio before
the latter part of April. The first that came under his notice was one
that he shot, on the <abbr title="twenty-third">23d</abbr> of that month, on the Medina River. It breeds
near the Medina and the San Antonio Rivers, making its nest in a hollow tree,
or taking possession of a deserted Woodpecker’s hole. Mr. Dresser observed
these birds as far to the east as the Guadaloupe River, where they were common.
Farther east he saw but very few. Their eggs he speaks of as peculiarly
marked with a multitude of purple and brown dashes and lines on a
dull yellowish-brown ground, and very similar to those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myiarchus crinitus</i>.</p>

<p>In the Mexican Boundary Survey, individuals of this species were taken
by Mr. A. Schott, March 31, on the Colorado Bottom; near the Gila River,
New Mexico, December 31; and also at Eagle Pass, in Texas, date not given.
Mr. J. H. Clark obtained a specimen at Frontera, Texas, where he mentions
finding it in great abundance in damp places, or near the water. In May,
1853, Lieutenant Couch secured several near Saltillo, and notes its occurrence
among mesquite-bushes. In the following June, Dr. Kennerly found
them very abundant at Los Nogales. Where two were found together, they
were generally noticed to be uttering a loud chattering noise.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann, in his Report on the birds observed in the survey of Lieutenant
Williamson’s route between the <abbr title="thirty-second">32d.</abbr> and the 35th parallels, mentions
finding this species abundant. His specimens were obtained near Posa
Creek. He describes them as of shy and retiring habits, preferring the deep
and shady forests where its insect food abounds. The nests, found in hollows
of trees or in a deserted squirrel’s or Woodpecker’s hole, were composed of
grasses and lined with feathers. The eggs, five in number, he describes as
cream-colored, marked and speckled with purplish-red dashes and faint
blotches of a neutral tint.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found them a common summer resident in Arizona, where they
arrived in the third week in April and remained until the middle of September.
They were seldom found among pine-trees, but appeared to prefer
ravines, hillsides, and creek bottoms. Some wintered as high up in the Colorado
Valley as Fort Mohave. At Fort Whipple young birds were first
observed early in July.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper obtained one of this species at Fort Mohave, January 15, and
is of the opinion that some may habitually winter in the Colorado Valley.
In California they begin to arrive about March 10, and extend their range
through very nearly the whole of the State. He describes their notes as
few, loud, and harsh, but little varied, and uttered from time to time as they
<!--381.png--><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 339]</span>
fly after an insect from an accustomed perch, usually a lower dead limb of
a forest tree. They prefer shady situations, and are said to feed late in the
evening.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway met with this species in all suitable localities, from the Sacramento
Valley eastward to the Wahsatch Mountains. It was most abundant
among the oaks of the plains between the Sacramento River and the
Sierra Nevada; but in the wooded river valleys of the interior, as well as in
the cedar and piñon or mahogany woods on the mountains of the latter
region, it was also more or less frequently met with. In its manners it is
described as a counterpart of the eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. crinitus</i>, but its notes, though
generally similar in character, have not that strength which makes the
vociferous screaming whistles of the eastern species so noticeable.</p>

<p>This species, or a very closely allied race of it (<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pertinax</i>) was procured
at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas by Mr. Xantus. It had the peculiarities of a
southern race, stronger feet, stouter bill, and a generally smaller size.</p>

<p>A few individuals of this species were found by Mr. Grayson inhabiting
the islands of the Three Marias, on the Pacific coast of Mexico. He usually
saw them among low bushes, darting from their perch after flies and other
winged insects. They were very silent, and seldom uttered a note.</p>

<p>Four eggs of this species from Matamoras, collected by the late Dr. Berlandier,
have the following measurements: .82 by .75, .91 by .71, .95 by .75,
.98 by .75 of an inch. Though having a very close resemblance to the eggs
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. crinita</i>, there are noticeable certain constant variations. The ground-color
is a little lighter, and has a tinge of pinkish not found in the eggs of
the eastern species. The markings are more in oblong plashes of irregular
shape, and rarely exhibit the waving lines. There are more and larger
blotches of a light purplish-brown. The eggs are a little more spherical in
their general shape, and the markings are less abundant. The eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M.
cooperi</i> have a still more roseate tint in the buff of the ground-color, are
marked with smaller blotches of bright purple and much larger ones of
lilac-brown. They measure .92 by .75 of an inch.</p>

<p>The female appears to differ only in the smaller size. A young bird from
San Francisco has two bands of rusty on the wing; the shoulders and
hinder part of the back tinged with the same.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Within our limits the Black Flycatcher has a distribution very
nearly corresponding with that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myiarchus cinerascens</i>. It is found from
Oregon and California on the Pacific coast, to the valley of the Rio Grande,
and thence south throughout Mexico. It also occurs as a resident in Guatemala.
Specimens in the Smithsonian Museum are from various parts of
Mexico, from New Mexico, and California.</p>

<p>During his explorations in Northern Mexico, Lieutenant Couch first met
with this species at Cadereita, Mexico, in April, occurring in abundance under
the high banks of the stream which supplies the town with water. Its habits
appeared to him to be much the same with those of the common Phœbe-Bird
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sayornis fuscus</i>). Its nest was supposed to be in the bank. Dr. Kennerly,
who found it at Espia, Mexico, could not observe any difference in the habits
from those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyrocephalus rubineus</i>. They were both observed in the
same vicinity, feeding alike on insects and having the same movements.</p>

<p>In the Department of Vera Cruz, Mr. Sumichrast says that this species is
known by the common name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aguador</i>. It is very common in both the
temperate and the colder regions of that State. It nests within the dwelling-houses
in the city of Orizaba.</p>

<p><!--384.png--><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 342]</span>
Dr. Kennerly states that after passing the mountains of California, and
descending into the valley of the San Gabriel River, he found these birds
quite abundant on the Pueblo Creek in New Mexico, though he had noticed
none previously. They were generally found perched upon the summit of a
bush, from which they would occasionally make short excursions in search
of prey. At the season in which they were observed, March, they were
rarely found in pairs, from which he inferred they were already hatching.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann speaks of it as abundant throughout all California, and
as constructing its nests in situations similar to those of the common
eastern species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. fuscus</i>). It seems to have a marked predilection for the
vicinity of streams and lakes, where it is nearly always to be seen, perched
upon a stake or branch. It occasionally darts into the air for an insect, and
returns to the same place to renew its watch and to repeat these movements.
The nest, composed of mud and mosses and lined with hair, is placed against
the rocks, the rafters of a house or bridge, or against the inside of a large
hollow tree, and the eggs, four or five in number, are pure white, speckled
with red.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found this Flycatcher a very abundant and permanent resident
in the valleys of the Gila and Colorado, and the more southern portions of
the Territory of Arizona generally. It was not observed in the immediate
vicinity of Fort Whipple, though it was detected a few miles south of that
locality. As it has been found on the Pacific coast so much farther north
than the latitude of Fort Whipple, he thinks it may yet be met with,
at least as a summer visitant to that place. In his journey from Arizona
to the Pacific, he ascertained that it is common throughout Southern Arizona,
being, among land birds, his most constant companion on the route.
Perched generally in pairs upon the dense verdure that in many places
overhangs the river, it pursued its constant vocation of securing the vagrant
insects around it, constantly uttering its peculiar unmelodious notes.
In all its movements the Pewee of the Eastern States was unmistakably
reproduced. It was rather shy and wary. In Southern Arizona and California
it remains throughout the winter. It seems to delight not only in
river bottoms, but also in deep mountain gorges and precipitous cañons
with small streams flowing through them.</p>

<p>Dr. Newberry found this species quite common in Northern California,
and specimens were also obtained as far to the north as the Umpqua Valley
in Oregon. According to Dr. Cooper it is an abundant and resident species in
all the lower parts of California, except the Colorado Valley, where he found
none later than March 25, as they had all evidently passed on farther north.
At San Diego, at that date, the following year (1862), all these birds had
nests and eggs, and were there, as elsewhere, the first birds to build. Their
nest, he states, is formed of an outer wall of mud about five and a quarter
inches wide and three and a half high. It is built like that of the Barn
Swallow, in little pellets, piled successively, as they dry, in the shape of
<!--385.png--><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 343]</span>
a half-cup. They are fastened to a wall, or sometimes placed on a shelf,
beam, or ledge of a rock, but are always under some protecting cover, often
under a bridge. They are lined with fine grass or moss, and horse or cow
hair. The eggs, four or five in number, he describes as pure white, measuring
.74 by .55 of an inch.</p>

<p>This bird is said to prefer the vicinity of human habitations, and also to
keep about water, on account of the numerous flies they find in such situations.
It will often sit for hours at a time on the end of a barn, or some
other perch, uttering a monotonous but not unpleasant ditty, which resembles,
according to Dr. Cooper, the sound of <i class="birdcall">pittic pittit</i>, alternately repeated, and
quite like the cry of the eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sayornis fuscus</i>, which is its exact counterpart
in habits. It is said to fly only a short distance at a time, turning and
dodging quickly in pursuit of its prey, which it captures with a sharp snap
of the bill.</p>

<p>This species was met with by Mr. Ridgway only in the vicinity of Sacramento
City, <abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>, where it seemed to replace our eastern Pewee, having the
same familiarity and general habits, and with notes not distinguishable from
some belonging to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. fuscus</i>.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species, as described by Dr. Cooper and by Dr. Heermann,
are either pure white unspotted, or else white with fine red dots, in this
respect resembling the eggs of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. fuscus</i>, which present the same variations.
The measurements of those in my cabinet vary from .75 by .56 of an
inch to .78 by .60.</p>

<p>Mr. Salvin says that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sayornis nigricans</i> is a resident species at Dueñas, in
Guatemala, where it may always be found at a short distance from the village,
up the stream of the river Guacatate. It also occurs about the lake.
In its actions it is described as a lively and restless species, in this respect
having but little resemblance to the Tyrant Flycatchers. It may always be
found near water, generally sitting on a stone on the margin, from which it
constantly darts to seize a fly or an insect from the surface. His remarks
may, however, refer to the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aquaticus</i>.</p>

San Antonio, Texas (<span class="sc">Dresser</span>, Ibis, 1865, 773, rare).</p>

<p>In autumn, and occasionally in early spring, the colors are much clearer
and brighter. Whole lower parts sometimes bright sulphur-yellow; above,
greenish-olive; top and sides of the head tinged with sooty. In the young
of the year the colors are much duller; all the wing-coverts broadly tipped
with light ferruginous, as also the extreme ends of the wings and tail-feathers.
The brown is prevalent on the whole throat and breast; the hind
part of the back, rump, and tail strongly ferruginous.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Pewee, or Phœbe-Bird, a well-known harbinger of early
spring, is a common species throughout the whole of eastern North America,
from the Rio Grande, on the southwest, to the provinces of Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick on the northeast, and as far west as the Missouri River.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse found it common both throughout Texas and in the Indian
Territory. It was taken by Sumichrast in the Department of Vera
Cruz, but he was in doubt whether it occurs there as a resident or is only
migratory. It was observed at San Antonio, Texas, but only as a migrant,
by both Dresser and Heermann; but at Houston, in that State, it evidently
remains and breeds, as individuals were seen there in June by Dresser.
Specimens were taken in February at Brownsville, Texas, by Lieutenant
Couch, and afterwards in March on the opposite side of the river,&mdash;in
Tamaulipas, Mexico.</p>

<p>In South Carolina, Dr. Coues found these birds most common in the
months of February and March, and again in October and November. He
had no doubt that some remain and pass the winter, and that others are
<!--387.png--><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 345]</span>
resident in the State during the summer months, but believes the great
majority go farther north to breed.</p>

<p>In Western Maine it is a common summer visitant, breeding there in considerable
numbers. Professor Verrill states that it is frequently seen there
the first of March, becoming quite common by the first of April. It is also
a summer visitant about Calais, where it breeds, but is rather rare. At
Hamilton, Canada, Mr. McIlwraith reports it as a common summer resident,
arriving about April 15.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania this species arrives among the earliest spring visitants,
sometimes as early as the first week in March, and continues in that region
until late in October. Wilson has seen specimens as late as the 12th of
November. He states that in the month of February he met with them
feeding on the smilax berries in the low, swampy woods of North and South
Carolina. They were already chanting their simple, plaintive notes. In
Massachusetts they usually arrive from the 15th to the 25th of March.
In the warm spring of 1870 they were already abundant by the 10th.
They were nesting early in April, and their first brood was ready to fly by
the middle of May. They have two broods in a season, and occasionally
perhaps three, as I have known fresh eggs in the middle of August. They
leave late in October, unless the season be unusually open, when a few linger
into November.</p>

<p>Their well-known and monotonous, though not unpleasing, note of <i class="birdcall">pē-wēē</i>,
or, as some hear it, <i class="birdcall">phœ-bēē</i>, is uttered with more force and frequency in
early spring than later in the season, though they repeat the note throughout
their residence north. It usually has some favorite situation, in which it
remains all the morning, watching for insects and continually repeating its
simple song. As he sits, he occasionally flirts his tail and darts out after
each passing insect, always returning to the same twig.</p>

<p>This species is attracted both to the vicinity of water and to the neighborhood
of dwellings, probably for the same reason,&mdash;the abundance of insects in
either situation. They are a familiar, confiding, and gentle bird, attached
to localities, and returning to them year after year. They build in sheltered
situations, as under a bridge, under a projecting rock, in the porches of
houses, and in similar situations. I have known them to build on a small
shelf in the porch of a dwelling; against the wall of a railroad-station, within
reach of the passengers; and under a projecting window-sill, in full view
of the family, entirely unmoved by the presence of the latter at mealtime.</p>

<p>Their nests are constructed of small pellets of mud, placed in layers one
above the other, in semicircular form, covered with mosses, and warmly lined
with fine straw and feathers. When the nest is placed on a flat surface,&mdash;a
shelf or a projecting rock,&mdash;it is circular in form, and mud is not made
use of. A nest of this description, taken by Mr. Vickary in Lynn, and containing
five eggs, was constructed on a ledge, protected by an overhanging
<!--388.png--><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 346]</span>
rock, only a few feet from the ground. It measured four and a half inches
in diameter and three in height. The cavity was nearly three inches wide
and one and a half deep. Its base was constructed of layers of fine leaves,
strips of bark, roots of plants, and other miscellaneous materials. The
great mass of the nest itself was made up of fine mosses closely interwoven,
and strengthened by an intermixture of firmer plant fibres. The whole was
carefully and softly lined with strips of the inner bark of various deciduous
shrubs, fine roots, and finer grasses. The semicircular nests are usually
placed out of reach of the weather under some projecting shelter.</p>

<p>Wilson states that they often nest in eaves, and occasionally in an open
well, five or six feet down, among the interstices of the side-walls. Nuttall
has known them to nest in an empty kitchen.</p>

<p>Their attachment to a locality, when once chosen, is remarkable, and is
often persevered in under the most discouraging circumstances. In one instance,
Nuttall states that a nest was built in the boathouse at Fresh Pond,
Cambridge,&mdash;a place so common as to be almost a thoroughfare. Although
with its young brood this nest was torn down by ruffian hands, the female
immediately built a new one in the same spot, and laid five additional eggs.
This was lined with the silvery shreds of a manilla rope, taken from the
loft over the boathouse.</p>

<p>Besides the common call-note, from which these birds derive their name,
they have, during the love-season, a low twittering song with which they
entertain their mates, but which is heard only when the birds are in company,
and for a brief season.</p>

<p>The flight of the Pewee is an alternation of soaring and a succession of
light fluttering motions, more rapid when pursuing its prey than in its
ordinary movements. Its crest is usually erected when it is in motion, or on
the lookout for insects.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon found these birds in full song in Florida during the winter,
and as lively as in spring, but met with none breeding south of Charleston.
They leave Louisiana in February, and return to it in October. They feed
largely on berries, especially during the winter, and Mr. Maynard found
some in the spring of 1868 with hawthorn berries in their stomachs.</p>

<p>The eggs of the Pewee measure .80 of an inch in length and .60 in breadth.
They are of a rounded oval shape, pointed at one end and much larger at the
other. Their ground-color is a pure bright white, and generally unspotted;
but a certain proportion, one set in every five or six, is distinctly marked
with reddish-brown dots at the larger end.</p>

North America, from Mexico, on the south, to the plains of the Saskatchewan

Ocean.</p>

<p>It was first discovered by Mr. Titian Peale on the Arkansas River, near
the Rocky Mountains, and described by Bonaparte. Mr. Peale noticed a
difference in its voice from that of the common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. fuscus</i>, and found it nesting
in a tree, building a nest of mud and moss, lined with dried grasses. Its
young were ready to fly in July. Richardson obtained individuals of this
species at the Carlton House, May 13. It is not given by Cooper and
Suckley in their Zoölogy of Washington Territory, but Dr. Newberry found
it not uncommon throughout both Oregon and California.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumichrast ascertained the presence of this bird within the Department
<!--390.png--><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 348]</span>
of Vera Cruz, but whether there as resident or as exclusively migratory he
was not able to state. It has also been found in winter throughout Mexico.
Mr. J. H. Clark met with it near Fort Webster, in New Mexico, and describes
it as particularly abundant about the copper mines. One of the shafts near
the fort, and which was partially filled up, served as a sinkhole for the offal
of the town, and around this quite a number of these birds could always be
seen in pursuit of flies and insects attracted to the place. Mr. Clark observed
that their sudden darting from their perch and their instantaneous return
were not always attended with the capture of an insect, but seemed at times
to be done only for amusement or exercise. Mr. Dresser first noticed these
birds in November, when walking in the gardens of the arsenal at San
Antonio. On his journey to Eagle Pass in December, he saw several daily,
generally in pairs. They would perch on a bush by the roadside, occasionally
darting off after some insect, and, as soon as he drew near, would fly off to a
convenient perch some distance ahead, thus keeping in advance for miles.
During the months of January and February they were not uncommon,
but after that he lost sight of them altogether. They seemed to prefer
the open country, as he generally found them on the prairies, and never
in the mesquite thickets. Their stomachs were found to contain small
insects.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse frequently met with these birds in Western Texas and in
New Mexico. They seemed more silent and more shy than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscus</i>, but
otherwise similar in their habits.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly met with this species at Bill Williams’s Fork, New Mexico,
February 10, 1854. He states that he found them common in Texas, and as
far to the westward as the Great Colorado River. They built their nests
under the cliffs along the stream, and in notes and in every other respect
closely resembled the common Pewee.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann mentions finding this species abundant in Southern California.
It was more especially plentiful in the fall, at the time of its migration
southward. He also found it in New Mexico, in the northern part of
Texas, near El Paso, and in Sacramento Valley, though somewhat rare. In
migrating, it prefers the deep valleys bordered by high hills, but also occurs
on the open plains, where, perched on the stalk of some dead weed, or on a
prominent rock, it darts forth in pursuit of its prey, to return to the same
point.</p>

<p>In Arizona, Dr. Coues found this Flycatcher common throughout the Territory.
At Fort Whipple it was a summer resident. It was one of the first
of the migratory birds to make its appearance in spring, arriving early in
March, and remained among the last, staying until October. It winters
in the Colorado Valley and the southern portions of the Territory generally.
He found it frequenting almost exclusively open plains, in stunted chaparral
and sage brush. In some other points of habits it is said to differ remarkably
from our other Flycatchers. It does not habitually frequent cañons,
<!--391.png--><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 349]</span>
rocky gorges, and secluded banks of streams, as does <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. fuscus</i>, nor does it
inhabit forests, like other Flycatchers.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper regards this bird as mostly a winter visitor in the southern
and western parts of California, where he has seen none later than March.
In summer it is said to migrate to the great interior plains as far to the
north as latitude 60<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. It arrives from the north at Los Angeles in September,
and perhaps earlier in the northern part of the State, and possibly <a name="note25" id="note25"></a>breeds
there east of the Sierras. Mr. Allen found it common in Colorado Territory,
among the mountains.</p>

<p>In the arid portions of the Great Basin this species was often seen by Mr.
Ridgway. In its natural state it preferred rocky shores of lakes or rivers,
or similar places in the cañons of the mountains, where it attached its bulky
down-lined nests to the inside of small caves or recesses in the rocks, usually
building them upon a small projecting shelf. Wherever man has erected
a building in those desert wastes,&mdash;as at the stage-stations along the road,
or in the mining towns,&mdash;it immediately assumed the familiarity of our
eastern Pewee, at once taking possession of any outbuilding or any abandoned
dwelling. Its notes differ widely from those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. fuscus</i> and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. nigricans</i>, the common one consisting of a wailing <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peer</i>, varied by a tremulous
twitter, and more resembling certain tones of the Wood Pewees (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Contopus
virens</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">richardsoni</i>), with others which occasionally call to mind
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myiarchus cinerascens</i>.</p>

<p>This species has been observed as far to the east as Racine, Wisconsin,
where it was taken by Dr. P. R. Hoy. The specimen was sent to Mr. Cassin,
and its identity fully established. Dr. Palmer found it breeding near
Fort Wingate, in Arizona, June 11, 1869, and Mr. Ridgway obtained its
nests and eggs at Pyramid Lake, Nevada, May 23, 1868. One of these
nests (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 13,588) he describes as a nearly globular mass, more flattened on
top, 3.50 inches in depth by 4.00 in diameter, and composed chiefly of spiders’
webs, with which is mixed very fine vegetable fibres, of various descriptions.
This composition forms the bulk of the nest, and makes a closely matted
and tenacious, but very soft structure; the neat but rather shallow cavity
is lined solely with the grayish-white down of wild ducks. The nest was
placed on a shelf inside a small cave on the shore of the island, at about
ten or twelve feet from the water.</p>

<p>Their eggs are rounded at one end and pointed at the other, measure .82
of an inch in length by .65 in breadth. They are of a uniform chalky white,
and, so far as I am aware, entirely unspotted.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="General Characters"><span class="sc">Gen. Char.</span></abbr>
Tarsus very short, but stout; less than the middle toe and scarcely longer
than the hinder; considerably less than the culmen. Bill quite broad at the base; wider
than half the culmen. Tail
moderately forked. Wings
very long and much pointed,

<p>This genus is pre-eminently characterized among North American Flycatchers
by the very short tarsi, and the long and much pointed wings.</p>

<p>In most other genera, as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sayoris, Myiarchus</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Empidonax</i>, a trace of a
cottony tuft may be discovered by careful search on the flanks; but in the

Wings long, much pointed; the second quill longest; the first longer than
the third. Tail deeply forked. Tarsi short. The upper parts ashy-brown, showing
darker brown centres of the feathers; this is eminently
the case on the top of the head; the sides of
the head and neck, of the breast and body, resembling
the back, but with the edges of the feathers
tinged with gray, leaving a darker central streak.
The chin, throat, narrow line down the middle of the
breast and body, abdomen, and lower tail-coverts
white, or sometimes with a faint tinge of yellow.
The lower tail-coverts somewhat streaked with brown
in the centre. On each side of the rump, generally
concealed by the wings, is an elongated bunch of
white silky feathers. The wings and tail very dark
brown, the former with the edges of the secondaries
and tertials edged with dull white. The lower wing-coverts
and axillaries grayish-brown. The tips of the
primaries and tail-feathers rather paler. Feet and
upper mandible black, lower mandible brown. The young of the year similar, but the
color duller; edges of wing-feathers dull rusty instead of grayish-white. The feet light
brown. Length, 7.50; wing, 4.33; tail, 3.30; tarsus, .60.</p>

<p>There is wonderfully little variation in this species, both in coloration and
size, with different regions; in fact none other than individual can be
observed. Contrary to the usual rule, spring specimens have a more
appreciable sulphur-yellow tinge below.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This still comparatively rare species was first obtained by Richardson
and described by Swainson. The specimen was shot on the Saskatchewan.
No other was taken, and no information was obtained in reference
to its habits. It appears to have been next met with by Mr. John Bethune,
in Cambridge, June 7, 1830, in the woods of Mount Auburn. This and a
<!--398.png--><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 354]</span>
second specimen, obtained soon after, were females, on the point of incubation.
A third female was shot in the following year, June 21. Supposed to
be a new species, it was described by Mr. Nuttall as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyrannus cooperi</i>. All
the specimens procured had their stomachs filled with torn fragments of bees,
wasps, and similar insects.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall, who watched the motions of two other living individuals of
this species, states that they appeared tyrannical and quarrelsome even with
each other. Their attacks were always accompanied with a whining, querulous
twitter. The disputes seemed to be about the occupancy of certain territories.
One bird, a female, appeared to confine herself to a small clump of red
cedars, in the midst of a sandy piece of forest. From the tree-tops she kept
a sharp lookout for passing insects, and pursued them, as they appeared, with
great vigor and success, sometimes chasing them to the ground, and returning
to her perch with a mouthful which she devoured at her leisure. When
she resumed her position, she would occasionally quiver her wings and tail,
erect her crest, keeping up a whistling call of <i class="birdcall">pŭ-pŭ</i>, uttered with variations.
Besides this call the male had a short song which sounded like <i class="birdcall">ch’-phe’bēē</i>.</p>

<p>The nest of this pair Mr. Nuttall discovered in the horizontal branch of a
tall red cedar, fifty feet from the ground. It was made externally of interlaced
dead twigs of the cedar, lined with wiry stems, and dry grasses, and
fragments of lichens. It contained three young, which remained in the nest
twenty-three days, and were fed on beetles and other insects. Before they
left their nests they could fly as well as their parents. The male bird was
very watchful, and would frequently follow Mr. Nuttall half a mile. They
were in no way timid, and allowed him to investigate them and their premises
without any signs of alarm.</p>

<p>In 1832 the same pair, apparently, took possession of a small juniper, near
the tree they had occupied the year before, in which, at the height of fifteen
feet, they placed their nest. It contained four eggs which, except in their
superior size, were precisely similar to those of the Wood Pewee, yellowish
cream-color, with dark brown and lavender-purple spots, thinly dispersed.
After removing two of these eggs, the others were accidentally rolled out of the
nest. The pair constructed another nest, again in a cedar-tree, at a short distance.
The next year they did not return to that locality. Mr. Nuttall afterwards
met with individuals of this species in the fir woods on the Columbia.</p>

<p>On the 8th of August, 1832, Mr. Audubon, in company with Mr. Nuttall,
obtained the specimen of this species in Brookline, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, from which his
drawing was made. In the course of his journey farther east, Audubon
found it in Maine, on the Magdeleine Islands, and on the coast of Labrador.
He afterwards met with it in Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. Boardman reports the Olive-sided Flycatcher as having of late years
been very abundant during the summer in the dead woods about the lakes
west of Calais, where formerly they were quite uncommon. Mr. Verrill
mentions it as a summer visitant in Oxford County, in the western part of
<!--399.png--><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 355]</span>
the State, but not very common, and as undoubtedly breeding there. It was
never observed there before the 20th of May. It is said to be more abundant
at Lake Umbagog.</p>

<p>In Western Massachusetts Mr. Allen regards this bird as a not very rare
summer visitant. It arrives about May 12, breeds in high open woods, and
is seldom seen at any distance from them. It leaves about the middle of
September.</p>

<p>Mr. William Brewster, who resides in Cambridge, in the neighborhood in
which this species was first observed by Mr. Nuttall, informs me that these
birds still continue to be found in that locality. He has himself met with
five or six of their nests, all of which were placed near the extremity of
some long horizontal branch, usually that of a pitch-pine, but on one occasion
in that of an apple-tree. The eggs were laid about the 15th of June,
in only one instance earlier. The females were very restless, and left their
nest long before he had reached it, and, sitting on some dead branch continually
uttered, in a complaining tone, notes resembling the syllables <i class="birdcall">pill-pill-pill</i>,
occasionally varying to <i class="birdcall">pu-pu-pu</i>. The males were fierce and quarrelsome,
and attacked indiscriminately everything that came near their
domain, sometimes seeming even to fall out with their mates, fighting savagely
with them for several seconds. When incubation was at all far
advanced, the birds evinced considerable courage, darting down to within a
few inches of his head, if he approached their nest, at the same time loudly
snapping their bills.</p>

<p>A nest of this Flycatcher was found in Lynn, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, by Mr. George O.
Welch, in June, 1858. It was built on the top of a dead cedar, and contained
three eggs. It was a flat, shallow structure, five inches in its external
diameter, and with a very imperfectly defined cavity. The greatest depth
was less than half an inch. It was coarsely and loosely built of strips of
the bark and fine twigs of the red cedar, roots, mosses, dry grasses, etc.
The nest was so shallow, that, in climbing to it, two of the eggs were rolled
out and broken.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles S. Paine has found this bird breeding in Randolph, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr> On
one occasion he found its nest on the top of a tall hemlock-tree, but was not
able to get to it.</p>

<p>In Philadelphia, Mr. Trumbull found this species very rare. It passed
north early in May, and south in September. Near Hamilton, Canada, it is
very rare, none having been seen; and two specimens obtained near Toronto
are all that Mr. McIlwraith is aware of having been taken in Canada West.</p>

<p>Dr. Hoy informs me that this species used to be quite common near
Racine, frequenting the edges of thick woods, where they nested. They have
now become quite scarce. Some years since, he found one of their nests,
just abandoned by the young birds, which their parents were engaged in
feeding. It was on the horizontal branch of a maple, and was composed
wholly of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usneæ</i>.</p>

<p><!--400.png--><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 356]</span>
In Washington Territory this bird appears to be somewhat more common
than in other portions of the United States. Dr. Suckley obtained a specimen
at Fort Steilacoom, July 10, 1856. It was not very abundant about
Puget Sound, and showed a preference for shady thickets and dense foliage,
where it was not easily shot. Dr. Cooper speaks of it as very common,
arriving early in May and frequenting the borders of woods, where, stationed
on the tops of tall dead trees, it repeats a loud and melancholy cry throughout
the day, during the whole of summer. It frequents small pine groves
along the coast, and also in the interior, and remains until late in September.</p>

<p>In California Dr. Cooper found this species rather common in the Coast
Range towards Santa Cruz, where they had nests in May; but as these were
built in high inaccessible branches, he was not able to examine them. He
also found it at Lake Tahoe in September.</p>

<p>This species was only met with by Mr. Ridgway in the pine woods high
up on the East Humboldt, Wahsatch, and Uintah Mountains. There it was
breeding, but was nowhere abundant, not more than two pairs being observed
within an area of several miles. They preferred the rather open pine
woods, and were shot from the highest branches. Their common note was a
mellow <i class="birdcall">puer</i>, much like one of the whistling notes of the Cardinal Grosbeak
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cardinalis virginianus</i>).</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser states it to be not uncommon near San Antonio in the winter
season. Dr. Heermann mentions that two specimens of this species were
obtained, to his knowledge, on the Cosumnes River, in California. It has
been taken in winter, in the State of Oaxaca, Mexico, by Mr. Boucard, and
has been met with at Jalapa, and even as far south as Guatemala.</p>

<p>A single specimen of this bird was taken, August 29, 1840, at Nenortalik,
Greenland, and sent to Copenhagen.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species measure .86 of an inch in length by .62 in breadth,
and are rounded at one end and sharply tapering at the other. The ground-color
is a rich cream-color with a roseate tint. They are beautifully marked
around the larger end with a ring of confluent spots of lilac, purple, and
red-brown. These vary in number and in the size of this crown, but the
markings are invariably about the larger end, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Contopus virens</i>.</p>

Mexico generally, into southern borders of United States (Fort Whipple,

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Dr. Coues found this species a rare summer resident at Fort
Whipple, where a single specimen was taken August 20, in good plumage.
This was its first introduction into the fauna of the United States. It is one
of several Mexican and peninsular birds found in Upper Arizona, probably
following the course of the valley of the Great Colorado River. No observations
were made in reference to its habits.</p>

<p>This species is abundant in the Department of Vera Cruz, according to
Mr. Sumichrast, who gives it as confined to the alpine region. He found
both it and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. virens</i> common in the mountains of Orizaba, between the

Young birds are duller in plumage; the whitish markings of wing tinged

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Wood Pewee of eastern North America occurs in
abundance from the Atlantic to the great plains, and from Texas to New
Brunswick. It breeds from South Carolina and Texas north. It is found in
Central and Southern Maine, but is not so abundant as it is farther south.
It is found near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephens, <abbr title="New Brunswick">N. B.</abbr>, and breeds in that vicinity, but is not
common. It is a summer visitant at Norway, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr>, but Professor Verrill
states that it is much less common than in Massachusetts, where it arrives
the last of May. At Hamilton, in Canada, Mr. McIlwraith records this
species as abundant in the summer, arriving there the middle of May. I am
not aware of its having been taken north of the 45th parallel of latitude, with
the exception of one at Red River, Minnesota, and another at Fort William
by Mr. Kennicott. It is said by Dr. Coues to be a summer resident of South
Carolina from the middle of April to the middle of October, and Mr. Dresser
states that he found it very common in the wooded river-bottoms near San
Antonio during the summer, not arriving there until late in April or early in
May. Their call-note, he states, is a low prolonged whistle. Their stomachs
were found to contain minute coleopterous insects. Dr. Woodhouse also
speaks of it as common in Texas and in the Indian Territory. In the Department
of Vera Cruz, Mr. Sumichrast found this species, as well as the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Contopus pertinax</i>, common in the mountains of Orizaba, between the height
of 3,600 and 7,500 feet.</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, Wilson states that the Wood Pewee is the latest of the
summer birds in arriving, seldom coming before the 12th or 15th of May.
He found it frequenting the shady high-timbered woods, where there is little
underwood and an abundance of dead twigs and branches. It was generally
found in low situations. He adds that it builds its nest on the upper
side of a limb or branch, formed outwardly of moss and lined with various
soft materials, and states that the female lays five white eggs, and that the
brood leave the nest about the middle of June. Probably the last statement
is correct as applied to Pennsylvania, but the intimation as to the color of
the egg and some of the characteristics of the nest is so inaccurate as to
make it doubtful whether Wilson could have ever seen the nest for himself.</p>

<p>This species, like all its family, is a very expert catcher of insects, even
the most minute, and has a wonderfully quick perception of their near
presence, even when the light of day has nearly gone and in the deep gloom
of thick woods. It takes its station on the end of a low dead limb, from
which it darts out in quest of insects, sometimes for a single individual,
which it seizes with a peculiar snap of its bill; and, frequently meeting insect
after insect, it keeps up a constant snapping sound as it passes on, and finally
returns to its post to resume its watch. During this watch it occasionally is
heard to utter a low twitter, with a quivering movement of the wings and
tail, and more rarely to enunciate a louder but still feeble call-note, sounding
<!--403.png--><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 359]</span>
like <i class="birdcall">pēē-ē</i>. These notes are continued until dark, and are also uttered
throughout the season.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall states that this species at times displays a tyrannical disposition,
and that it has been observed to chase a harmless Sparrow to the
ground, because it happened to approach his station for collecting insects.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Audubon, some of these birds spend the winter months
in the extreme Southern States, Louisiana and Florida, where they feed upon
berries as well as insects.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts the Wood Pewee is a very abundant species, and may
usually be found in any open woods, or in an orchard of large spreading
trees. In the latter situation it frequently breeds. It usually selects a
lower dead limb of a tree, from ten to thirty feet from the ground, and occasionally,
but more seldom, a living moss-grown branch. It always chooses
one that is covered with small lichens, and saddles its nest upon its upper
surface, so closely assimilated by its own external coating of lichens as not
to be distinguishable from a natural protuberance on the limb. This structure
is extremely beautiful, rivalling even the artistic nests of the Humming-Bird.
It is cup-shaped, and a perfect segment of a sphere in shape. The
periphery of the nest is made of fine root fibres, small lichens, and bits of
cobwebs and other similar materials. The outer sides are entirely covered
with a beautiful coating of mosses and lichens, glued to the materials with
the saliva of the builder. The eggs are usually four in number, measure
.78 of an inch in length and .55 in breadth. They are obtuse at one end
and tapering at the other, have a ground of a rich cream-color, and are
marked about the larger end with a wreath of blended purple, lilac, and red-brown
in large and confluent spots. They hatch about the middle of June,
leave the nest in July, and have but a single brood.</p>

<p>A nest of this species, taken in Lynn by Mr. Welch, and built on the
dead branch of a forest tree, has a diameter of three and a height of one and
a half inches. The cavity has a depth of one inch, and a diameter, at the
rim, of two and a half inches. The base is flattened by its position. Its
walls are strongly woven of fine dry stems, intermingled with vegetable
down, covered externally with lichens, cemented to the exterior, apparently
by the secretions of the bird. The base is thinner, and made of softer
materials.</p>

<p>During the winter months this species is present as a migrant in various
parts of Mexico, south to Guatemala.</p>

General appearance of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. virens</i>. Bill broad. Wings very long and much
pointed, considerably exceeding the tail; second quill longest; third a little shorter; first
shorter than fourth, and about midway between distance from second to fifth (.60 of
an inch). Primaries 1.20 inches longer than secondaries. Tail moderately forked.
Above dark olive-brown (the head darker); the entire breast and sides of head, neck,
and body of a paler shade of the same, tingeing strongly also the dull whitish throat and
chin. Abdomen and under tail-coverts dirty pale-yellowish. Quills and tail dark
blackish-brown; the secondaries narrowly, the tertials more broadly edged with whitish.
Two quite indistinct bands of brownish-white across the wings. Lower mandible yellow;
the tip brown. Length, 6.20; wing, 3.65; tail, 3.10.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>

<p>This species has a very close relationship to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. virens</i>, agreeing with it in
general shape of wings and in color. The wings are, however, still longer
and more pointed; the primaries exceeding the secondaries by nearly 1.25
inches. The proportions of the quills are nearly the same in both; the
primaries, too, are similarly a little emarginated or attenuated towards the
end. The tail is rather more deeply forked, the feathers broader. The
bills are similar; the feet are larger and stouter.</p>

<p>The general colors are almost precisely the same. The outer primary,
however, lacks the decidedly white margin. The under parts are much
darker anteriorly, the entire breast being nearly a uniform olive-brown, but
little paler than the back; the throat, too, in some specimens, being scarcely
paler. There is little or none of the pale sulphur-yellow of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. virens</i> on the
abdomen, and the under wing-coverts and axillaries are much darker olivaceous.
In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. virens</i> the middle line of the breast is always paler than the
sides, or at least the connecting space is short.</p>

<p>The lower mandible is generally yellow; in a few specimens, however, it
is quite dusky, especially on its terminal half.</p>

<p>The young bird has the darker head and broader light edgings, with the
ferruginous tinge on the wing-markings, usually seen in young of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyrannulas</i>.</p>

<p><!--405.png--><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 361]</span>
A large series shows considerable variations; autumnal specimens have a
more appreciable tinge of yellow on the lower parts, while summer individuals
are more grayish.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species was first obtained by Richardson in the Arctic
regions, and described by Swainson. It was found in the neighborhood of
the Cumberland House, where it frequented moist shady woods by the
banks of rivers and lakes. It was supposed likely to travel in summer as
far as the shores of the Great Slave Lake.</p>

<p>Since its discovery by Richardson, this Flycatcher has been found to have
a widely extended geographical range, as far to the south as Guatemala, and
even Panama, and northward as far as the 60th parallel of latitude, and from
the great plains to the Pacific.</p>

<p>During the survey of the Mexican Boundary, specimens of this bird were
obtained by Mr. J. H. Clark in El Paso, Texas, and in the month of May by
Lieutenant Couch in Monterey, Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser found that this bird was very common near Matamoras during
the summer, and that they were breeding there. He also shot one specimen
near San Antonio in May. Its stomach contained small insects. Dr.
Coues thinks this Flycatcher an exceedingly abundant summer resident in the
Territory of Arizona. It arrives there in spring about the first of May, the
latest of the Flycatchers, and is deemed by the Doctor a counterpart of the
eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Contopus virens</i>. It departs from that Territory about the third week
in September. It is found in all situations, but most especially in open forests.</p>

<p>This species arrives in California, according to Dr. Cooper, at least a fortnight
earlier than the date of its earliest advent in Arizona as given by Dr.
Coues, or about the 15th of April, and spends its summers in the most
mountainous parts of the State. It is said to perch mainly on the lower
dead limbs, watching for the passing insects, uttering occasionally a plaintive
<i class="birdcall">pe-ah</i>. It is usually very silent, and seems to prefer the dark, solitary
recesses of the forests.</p>

<p>Dr. Hoy informs me that this Flycatcher is occasionally found in the
neighborhood of Racine, but that it is rare. It keeps in the deep forest,
and never comes near dwellings in the manner of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. virens</i>.</p>

<p>This bird was found breeding at Fort Tejon by Mr. Xantus, at Napa
Valley by Mr. A. J. Grayson, and both in the Sacramento Valley and at
Parley’s Park, among the Wahsatch Mountains, by Mr. Ridgway.</p>

<p>A nest of this bird in the Smithsonian Museum (10,076) from California,
collected by W. Vuille, had been apparently saddled on the limb of a tree,
in the manner of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. virens</i>, having a broad flattened base, and a general
resemblance to the nests of that species. It differs, however, somewhat in
regard to materials, and most especially in having no lichens attached to the
exterior. It has a diameter of three inches and a height of one and a half.
The cavity is about one inch deep and two wide at the rim. The base and
sides of this nest are largely composed of the exuviæ of chrysalides, intermingled
<!--406.png--><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 362]</span>
with hemp-like fibres of plants, stems, and fine dry grasses. The
rim is firmly wrought of strong wiry stems, and a large portion of the inner
nest is of the same material. The whole is warmly and thoroughly lined
with the soft fine hair of small quadrupeds and with vegetable fibres.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Ridgway, this is the most abundant and generally diffused
of all the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyrannuli</i> of the Great Basin, as well as of California. It inhabits
every grove of the lowest valleys, as well as the highest aspen copses on
the mountains in the alpine region, and breeds abundantly in all these
places. Resembling the eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. virens</i> in its general habits, its appearance,
and its every motion, it yet differs most widely from it in notes, the common
one being a disagreeable weird squeak, very unlike the sad, wailing,
but not unpleasant one of the eastern Wood Pewee. Mr. Ridgway relates
that having shot a female bird, and taken her nest and eggs, he was surprised,
a few days afterwards, to find the male with another mate, and a new nest
built in precisely the same spot from which the other had been taken.
Upon climbing to the nest, it was found to contain one egg; and the parents
exhibited very unusual distress. When visited two or three days after, it
was found to be deserted and the egg broken.</p>

<p>The eggs, three in number, measure .69 of an inch in length and .53 in
breadth. They have a ground of beautiful cream-color slightly tinged with
a roseate tint, surrounded at the larger end with a wreath of purple and
reddish-brown spots. A few smaller markings are sparingly distributed, but
nearly all are about the larger end.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="General Characters"><span class="sc">Gen. Char.</span></abbr>
Tarsus lengthened, considerably longer than the bill, and exceeding the
middle toe, which is decidedly longer than
the hind toe. Bill variable. Tail very
slightly forked, even, or rounded; a little
shorter only than the wings, which are
considerably rounded; the first primary
much shorter than the fourth. Head
moderately crested. Color olivaceous
above, yellowish beneath; throat generally
gray.</p>

<p>The lengthened tarsi, the short
toes, the short and rounded wings,
and the plain dull olivaceous of the
plumage, readily distinguish the
species of this genus from any other North American Flycatchers. The
upper plates of the tarsi in a good many species do not encircle the outside,
but meet there a row on the posterior face.</p>

<p><!--407.png--><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 363]</span>
There are few species of North American birds more difficult to distinguish
than the small Flycatchers, the characters, though constant, being very
slight and almost inappreciable, except to a very acute observer.</p>

<p>In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Empidonax</i>, as well as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Contopus</i>, autumnal birds have the plumage
softer and the colors brighter than in spring; the brilliancy of the yellow
shades is especially enhanced. The young of the year resemble the parents,
but there is a greater tendency to light bands on the wings, which with the
other markings of this region show an ochraceous tinge. The lower mandible
is also usually tinged with dusky. In the young of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. acadica</i>, alone,
there are light transverse bars over upper surface, as in the young of some
species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Contopus</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. bahamensis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. punensis</i>).</p>

<p>This race represents the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trailli</i> in the region west of the Rocky
Mountains. The present bird is paler colored than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trailli</i>, the olivaceous above
much more grayish anteriorly, and more brownish posteriorly, the olive
being thus less greenish and less uniform in tint; the brownish shade
across the breast is lighter and more ashy, and the yellow tinge posteriorly
beneath more faint; the wing-bands lighter and more grayish. In color,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pusillus</i> thus approximates somewhat to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. minimus</i>, which, however, is a
very distinct species, and more closely related to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. hammondi</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minimus</i>
may be distinguished by much smaller size (the bill especially), the wing-bands
grayish-white instead of olive-gray, and the tail emarginated instead
of appreciably rounded; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minimus</i> lays a white egg like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. obscurus</i>, while
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pusillus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">trailli</i> lay distinctly spotted ones, and build a very different nest.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Professor Baird, in his Birds of North America, assigns to this
species an area of distribution extending from the Great Plains to the
Pacific, southward into Mexico, and north to the fur country. Dr. Hoy cites
it as of Wisconsin in his List of the birds of that State, but without positive
data for this claim; it has, however, since been actually taken, a summer
<!--411.png--><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 367]</span>
resident breeding in Jefferson County, in that State. This is its most eastern
known occurrence. In the Smithsonian Museum are skins from Fort
Steilacoom, Fort Tejon, and Mexico. This species is probably identical with
the Little Tyrant Flycatcher, described by Swainson in the Fauna Boreali
as both from Mexico and from the Arctic regions. Dr. Richardson was not
able to supply anything in regard to its habits. They were first seen by
him at the Carlton House on the 19th of May. For a few days they were
found flitting about among low bushes on the banks of the river, after which
they retired to moist shady woods lying farther north.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway mentions the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. pusillus</i> as the most common of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Empidonaces</i>
in the Great Basin, as well as in California and the Rocky Mountains.
It is chiefly, if not entirely, confined to the willows along streams,
but it is as common in the river valleys as in the mountain “parks.” In all
respects it is a counterpart of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. trailli</i>; its notes, as well as its manners,
being the same. In Parley’s Park, in the Wahsatch Mountains, at an elevation
of over 7,000 feet, they were breeding abundantly; about nightfall
they became particularly active, chasing each other, with a merry twitter,
through the willow thickets, or, as they perched upon a dry twig, uttered
frequently, with swelling throats and raised crest, their odd but agreeable
enunciation of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pretty dear</i>, as their notes were translated by the people of
the locality.</p>

<p>In the Department of Vera Cruz, Mexico, Mr. Sumichrast gives this species
as a summer resident within the temperate region. He found it quite
common around Orizaba in the months of June and July.</p>

<p>It was also met with on the Mexican Boundary Survey in summer, having
been taken in June at Los Nogales by Dr. Kennerly, and at <a name="note20" id="note20"></a>Rio Nazas,
in Durango, by Lieutenant Couch, the same month.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues mentions it as moderately plentiful as a summer resident in
Arizona. None of this genus were very common at Fort Whipple, but this
one was by far the most characteristic species. It arrives there about the
middle of April, and remains through September.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley found this species quite abundant in the vicinity of Fort
Steilacoom, where it arrives early in May. It seems to prefer the vicinity
of bushes and low trees at the edges of dense forests. This species, he adds,
is rather less pugnacious than others of the group, and in habits generally
more resembles the Vireo family. Its notes are said to be short but sweet,
and just after sundown on warm summer evenings particularly low, plaintive,
and soothing.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper speaks of it as found by him frequenting the dark and gloomy
spruce forests, which it seems to prefer to more open places. He found it
most numerous near the coast, but also saw a few at Puget Sound, where
it arrived about the 25th of April. He speaks of its song as lively but
monotonous. He found it very difficult to get a sight of this bird among
the upper branches of the tall spruces, its color making it almost invisible in
<!--412.png--><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 368]</span>
the shade. One of these birds was observed to keep constantly on the
border of a small pond and to drive away a Kingbird from the place. He
adds that it has a peculiar short and lisping song of three notes, very different
from those of the other species. In the fall the young birds uttered a
very different call-note.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway found this species breeding, June 23, at Parley’s Park, Utah.
One nest was built on the horizontal branch of a willow, over a stream,
about four feet from the ground. It was partly pensile. It was three
inches deep and four in diameter; the cavity was two inches wide and one
and a half deep. Externally the nest was somewhat loosely constructed of
flaxen fibres of plants, soft strips of inner bark and straw, and lined more
firmly with fine roots of plants. This structure was firmly bound around the
smaller branches of the limb. The inner nest was much more compactly interwoven
than the periphery. The eggs, four in number, were of a chalky
whiteness, more pinkish when unblown, finely sprinkled at the larger end
with reddish-brown dots. Length, .77 of an inch; breadth, .51.</p>

<p>Another nest from the same locality was built in the upright fork of a
wild rose, in the undergrowth of a willow thicket, and about four feet from
the ground. It is a much more compact and homogeneous nest. Its external
portion was almost wholly composed of the interweaving of the fine
inner bark of deciduous shrubs, blended with a few stems of grasses, feathers,
etc., and is lined with a few fine grass stems and fibrous roots. The
eggs, four in number, have a pinkish-white ground, and are spotted at the
larger end with reddish-brown and chestnut spots, in scattered groups.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1870 a son of Mr. Thure Kumlien, of Jefferson <abbr title="County">Co.</abbr>,
Wisconsin, found the nest and eggs of this species. Both parents were obtained,
and were fully identified by Professor Baird. The nest was placed in
a thick mass of coarse marsh grasses, near the ground, and firmly interwoven
with the tops of the surrounding herbage. The grass and reeds, among which
it was made, grew in the midst of water, and it was discovered by mere accident
in a hunt for rail’s eggs. It was found, June 28, on the edge of Lake
Koskonong. It is a large nest for the bird; its base and sides are made of
masses of soft lichens and mosses, and within this a neat and firm nest is
woven of bits of wool and fine wiry stems of grasses, and lined with
the same. The eggs measure .70 by .54 of an inch, are white with a pinkish
tinge, and are marked with reddish-brown and fainter lilac blotches at
the larger end.</p>

secondaries. Tail even. Upper parts dark olive-green; lighter under the wings, and
duller and more tinged with ash on nape and sides of the neck. Centre of the crown-feathers
brown. A pale yellowish-white ring (in some specimens altogether white) round
the eye. Loral feathers mixed with white. Chin and throat white; the breast and sides
of throat light ash tinged with olive, its intensity varying in individuals, the former
sometimes faintly tinged with olive. Sides of the breast much like the back. Middle of

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Eastern United States and south to Mexico. Localities: ? Isthmus of Panama
(<abbr title="Lawrence Eight"><span class="sc">Lawr.</span> VIII</abbr>, 63); ? San Antonio, Texas (<span class="sc">Dresser</span>, Ibis, 1865, 474, breeds); ? Costa
Rica (<abbr title="Lawrence Nine"><span class="sc">Lawr.</span> IX</abbr>, 114); Yucatan (<abbr title="Lawrence Nine"><span class="sc">Lawr.</span> IX</abbr>, 201). All these localities, except perhaps
the last, are to be questioned, as being more properly in the habitat of <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pusillus</i>.</p>

<p>This species is most closely related to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. minimus</i>, but differs in larger
size and the proportions of quills. The middle of the back is the same
color in both, but instead of becoming lighter and tinged with ash on the
rump and upper tail-coverts, these parts very rarely differ in color from the
back. The markings on the wings, instead of being dirty white, are
decidedly olivaceous-grayish. The yellow of the lower parts is deeper.
The tail-feathers are rather broad, acuminate, and pointed; in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minimus</i> they
are narrow and more rounded, while the tail itself is emarginated, instead
of square, as in the present bird. The bill is larger and fuller. The legs are
decidedly shorter in proportion.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Traill’s Flycatcher was first described by Mr. Audubon as a western
bird, procured from Arkansas. In his subsequent reference to this species
he also speaks of it as identical with several birds obtained by Townsend near
the Columbia River, but which our present knowledge as to the distribution
of this species compels us to presume to have been specimens of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Empidonax
pusillus</i>, a closely allied species or race. That Traill’s Flycatcher does
occur in Arkansas, on the other hand, is rendered probable by its abundance
in other parts of the country, making this region directly within its range of
<!--414.png--><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 370]</span>
migration. Dr. Woodhouse found it very common both in Texas and in
the Indian Territory. Mr. Dresser found it common during the summer
season near San Antonio, and to the eastward, breeding there, and building a
small hanging nest. He also had its eggs sent to him from Systerdale. The
stomach of the specimen he procured contained minute insects. It is mentioned
by Dr. E. Coues as found in South Carolina, but whether as a migrant
or as a resident is not stated. Dr. William P. Turnbull refers to it as rare near
Philadelphia, and as only a spring and autumnal migrant. Mr. McIlwraith
cites it as a rare summer visitant near Hamilton, Canada West. It is
mentioned by Mr. Boardman as found near Calais, but has not been recorded
as occurring in Nova Scotia, as far as I am aware. In Western Maine, Professor
Verrill found it a regular but not a common summer visitant, arriving
there the third week in May. And Mr. Brewster found it breeding in considerable
abundance near Lake Umbagog in the summer of 1872.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts it has been found to occur very irregularly, and so far
chiefly as a migrant, at least I am not aware that it has been known, except
in a single instance, to breed within the limits of that State. It passes
through the State about the middle of May, is rare some seasons, much more
abundant for a few days in others. Near Springfield Mr. Allen regarded it
as a rather rare summer visitant, arriving from the 10th to the 15th of May,
and also mentioned it as probably breeding. A number have been taken in
Lynn by Mr. Welch, but none have been observed to remain more than
a day or two. Mr. Maynard once met with it on the 1st of June, 1869, in
a swampy thicket. It was very shy, and he heard no note.</p>

<p>This species was observed by Mr. Paine, at Randolph, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, where it was
found to be a not uncommon, though very retiring and shy species. It
was found frequenting shady thickets, on the borders of the mountain
streams, and several of its nests were procured. The bird was thoroughly
identified, specimens of the parents having been sent to Professor Baird for
verification. Mr. Paine was not able to obtain much insight into the manners
and habits of this species, on account of its shyness. The nests were
always placed in low alder-bushes, near running streams, and not more than
three or four feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Mr. Paine has since informed me that Traill’s Flycatcher reaches Central
Vermont from the 20th to the 25th of May, and is one of the last birds to
arrive, coming in company with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Contopus virens</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. borealis</i>. They all
leave before the close of September. Mr. Paine has met with a great many
nests of this species, but has only found one containing more than three
eggs. It has a very simple song, consisting of but two notes. It has also a
sort of twitter as it plays with its mate. They are usually found in thickets,
for the most part near water, but not always, and are never seen in tall
woods. They are occasionally seen chasing one another in the open fields.</p>

<p>Mr. William Brewster informs me that he found Traill’s Flycatcher moderately
common and breeding at the foot of Mount Washington, in the Glen,
<!--415.png--><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 371]</span>
in August, 1869, and in the township of Newry, <abbr title="Maine">Me.</abbr>, in June, 1871. Their
favorite haunts were the dense alder thickets along the runs and small
streams, over these dark retreats, perched on some tall dead branch, full in
the rays of the noonday sun. The male sang vigorously, occasionally
darting out after some insect, and returning to the same perch. His song
consisted of a single dissyllabic refrain, <i class="birdcall">ke´wing</i>, uttered in a harsh peevish
tone at an interval of about thirty seconds, varied occasionally to <i class="birdcall">ke´wink</i>,
or <i class="birdcall">ki-winch</i>. At each utterance his head is thrown upwards with a sudden
jerk. They were retiring, but not shy, were easily approached, and were
apparently not so restless as most Flycatchers.</p>

<p>Near Washington, Dr. Coues found Traill’s Flycatcher a rare spring and
fall visitant, a few possibly remaining to breed. They came about the last
of April, and passed south the last of September. Professor Baird frequently
met with them about Carlisle, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Pa.</abbr></p>

<p>In Southern Illinois, Mr. Ridgway has found this species a rather common
summer resident, chiefly met with in the open woods. It was found nesting
in Northwestern Massachusetts by Mr. A. Hopkins, in Illinois by Mr. Tolman,
in New Brunswick by Mr. Barnstow, and at Fort Resolution by Messrs.
Kennicott, Ross, and Lockhart.</p>

<p>I have myself found this species on the banks of the Androscoggin
and Peabody Rivers in Gorham, and met with several of their nests.
They were all in similar situations, and it was quite impossible to obtain
a glimpse of the bird after she had left her nest. The nests were all made
like those of the Indigo-Bird, externally of dry grasses and fine strips of
bark, and lined with finer stems of grasses. The eggs were five in number,
and incubation commenced about the first of June. I have discovered their
nests at the same time among the foot-hills at the base of Mount Washington,
its wooded sides being, at the time, covered with snow to the depth of
several feet.</p>

<p>Among the memoranda of Mr. Kennicott I find one dated Fort Resolution,
July 9, mentioning the procuring of the parent nest and egg of this species.
The nest was three feet from the ground, in a small spruce among thick low
bushes. The female was shot on the nest, which contained two young and
two eggs. Eggs of this species from Gorham, <abbr title="New Hampshire">N. H.</abbr>, and Coventry and
Randolph, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, do not essentially vary in size or shape. They measure
.63 of an inch in length, by .56 in breadth. Their ground-color is white,
with a distinctly roseate tinge. They are oval in shape, a little less obtuse
at one end, and marked almost entirely about the larger end with large and
well-defined spots and blotches of purplish-brown.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The distinctness of this species from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acadica</i>, with which it
had been previously confused, was first pointed out by the Messrs. Baird in
1843, but it was some time before the complete differences between the two
species and their distinctive habits and distribution were fully appreciated
and known. This species, one of the commonest birds in the State of
Massachusetts, where the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. acadica</i> is nearly or quite unknown, was supposed
by Mr. Nuttall to be the latter species, and under that name is treated
and its history given. Wilson contributed to cause this error. For although
his account of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acadica</i> is in part correct, it is not wholly free from error,
and probably the nest and eggs described as belonging to the latter were
those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minima</i>. The discovery, by Professor Baird, of the nest and
eggs of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acadica</i>, and their marked difference in all respects from those of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minima</i>, which had hitherto been attributed to it, at once pointed out
the errors that had prevailed, and permitted the real facts to be appreciated.</p>

<p>This bird is an abundant species throughout Eastern North America, occurring
as a migrant in all the States between the Atlantic and the Great Plains,
and breeding from the 40th parallel northward over an extent not fully defined,
but probably to within the Arctic Circle. It occurs in great numbers from
Maine to Nebraska, and, unlike all the other species of this genus, is not shy

or retiring, but frequents the open grounds, visits gardens, is found in the
vicinity of dwellings, and breeds even in the vines that half conceal their
windows and doors.</p>

<p>This Flycatcher reaches Washington, according to Dr. Coues, the last of
April, and remains about two weeks. It returns in autumn the third week
in August, and remains till the last of September. It is only a spring and
autumnal visitant, none breeding, and is rather common. It frequents the
margins of small streams and brooks.</p>

<p>I am not aware that the nest of this species has ever been procured farther
south than New York City, yet it is given by Mr. Dresser as having been
found common by him, through the summer, near San Antonio. It is not,
however, mentioned by Dr. Woodhouse, nor by the Mexican Survey, nor was
it met with by Sumichrast in Vera Cruz. It is cited by Dr. Coues as only
a migrant in South Carolina. Near Philadelphia Mr. Turnbull gives it as
a somewhat rare migrant, passing north in April and returning in September,
but adds that a few remain to breed. I did not find it breeding in the vicinity
of Newark, nor, among a very extensive collection of nests and eggs
made in that neighborhood, were there any eggs of this species. It is mentioned
by Mr. Boardman as occurring at Calais, and in the western part of the
State Mr. Verrill found it a very common summer visitant, arriving there
about the middle of May and breeding there in numbers. It is also an exceedingly
frequent summer visitant at Hamilton, Canada West, according
to Mr. McIlwraith. It is found during the winter months near Oaxaca,
Mexico, according to Mr. Boucard, and has been met with throughout Mexico
and south to Guatemala.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts this Flycatcher is one of the most abundant and familiar
species, arriving from about the 20th of April to the 1st of May. It is found
most frequently in orchards, gardens, and open grounds, and very largely on
the edges of woods, remaining until October. They are much addicted to
particular localities, and return to the same spot year after year, if undisturbed.
A pair that had established their hunting-grounds in an open area
north of a dwelling in Roxbury returned to the same spot for several successive
years, and would come regularly to the piazza of the house, where
bits of cotton were exposed for the benefit of such of the whole feathered
tribe as chose to avail themselves of it. Each year they drew nearer and
nearer the house, until at last the nest was made in a clump of honeysuckle
on the corner of the piazza, from which they would sally forth in quest of
insects, entirely unmindful of the near presence of the family. I never
observed the quarrelsome disposition that Nuttall speaks of, nor have I ever
seen them molest other birds, even when the summer Yellow-Birds and the
Chipping Sparrows have nested in the same clump. They are very silent
birds, having no song and no other cry or note than a very feeble, guttural
utterance, given out either as a single sound or as a succession of twitters.
Their nest is a very common receptacle for the eggs of the Cow Blackbird.</p>

<p><!--418.png--><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 374]</span>
This species was found breeding at Fort Resolution, latitude 62<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, by Mr.
Kennicott, the nest being in an alder-bush, and about five feet from the
ground. It was also found nesting in the same locality by Mr. Ross and by
Mr. Lockhart. Its nest was found at Lake Manitobah by Mr. McTavish,
and at Fort Simpson by Mr. Ross.</p>

<p>This species has been gradually undergoing certain modifications of habits
and manners in consequence of its contact with civilization and becoming
familiarized to the society of man. In nothing is this made more apparent
than in the construction of its nests. Those made on the edge of woodlands
or in remote orchards are wrought almost entirely of fine deciduous bark,
hempen fibres of vegetables, feathers, dried fragments of insect cocoons, and
other miscellaneous substances felted and impacted together; within this is
a lining of fine strips of vegetable bark, woody fibres, fine lichens, and soft
downy feathers. In some the lining is exclusively of fine pine leaves, in
others with the seeds or pappus of compositaceous plants. The nests are
always quite small, rarely measuring more than three inches in diameter or
two in height. Those made in the vicinity of dwellings indicate their neighborhood
by the variety of miscellaneous and convenient materials, such as
bits of paper, rags, cotton, wool, and the larger and more conspicuous feathers
of the poultry-yard. Where raw cotton was abundantly provided, I have
known this material, strengthened with a few straws and woody fibres, with
a lining of feathers, constitute the whole substance of the nest.</p>

<p>One nest, constructed in a thick tamarack swamp in Wisconsin, is composed
of a dense, impacted mass of a dirty white vegetable wool, intertwined
at the base with shreds of bark, vegetable stems, and small black
roots. The inner rim and frame of the nest are made of black, shining rootlets,
intermingled with slender leaves and stems of dry sedges, and lined
with the pappus of a small composite plant and a few feathers.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are pure white, never, so far as I am aware, spotted,
of a rounded-oval shape, nearly equally obtuse at either end, and measuring
about .60 of an inch in length by .50 in breadth.</p>

The upper parts, with sides of the head and neck, olive-green; the crown very little if
any darker. A yellowish-white ring round the eye. The sides of the body under the
wings like the back, but fainter olive; a tinge of the same across the breast; the chin,
throat, and middle of the belly white; the abdomen, lower tail and wing coverts, and
sides of the body not covered by the wings, pale greenish-yellow. Edges of the first
primary, secondaries, and tertials margined with dull yellowish-white, most broadly on
the latter. Two transverse bands of pale yellowish (sometimes with an ochrey tinge)
across the wings, formed by the tips of the secondary and primary coverts, succeeded by
a brown one. Tail light brown, margined externally like the back. Upper mandible
light brown above; pale yellow beneath. In autumn the lower parts are more yellow.

<p>This species is very similar to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. trailli</i>, but the upper parts are of a
brighter and more uniform olive-green, much like that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireo olivaceus</i>.
The feathers of the crown lack the darker centre. There is less of the
olivaceous-ash across the breast. The bands across the wing are light
yellowish, instead of grayish-olive. There is much more yellow at the
base of the lesser quills. The wings are longer, both proportionally and
absolutely. The primaries exceed the secondaries by nearly an inch,
instead of by only about .70; the proportions of the quills are much the
same.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species belongs to Eastern North America, but its distribution
north and east is not determined with entire certainty. I have never
met with or received any evidence of its breeding northeast of Philadelphia.
Nuttall’s account of this bird so blends what he had ascertained
in regard to the habits of a different species with what he derived from
other writers, that his whole sketch must be passed as unreliable. It is
shy and retiring in its habits, frequenting only lonely places, and would
readily escape notice, so that its presence in New Jersey, New York, and
even New England, may not be uncommon, although we do not know
it. Mr. Lawrence mentions its occurring in the vicinity of New York
City; but I can find no evidence whatever that a single specimen of this
bird has ever been procured in any part of New England, except Mr.
Allen’s mention of finding it near Springfield. That it is found in the
immediate neighborhood of Philadelphia I have positive evidence, having
received its nest and eggs, found in West Philadelphia. Mr. Turnbull
gives it as of frequent occurrence from the beginning of May to the middle
of September. He generally met with it in the most secluded parts of
woods. Mr. McIlwraith calls it a rare summer resident near Hamilton,
Canada West.</p>

<p>I am informed by Mr. Thomas H. Jackson, an accurate observer, resident
in Westchester, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Pa.</abbr>, that this Flycatcher arrives in that neighborhood early
<!--420.png--><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 376]</span>
in May, constructing its nest about the first of June. This is generally
placed on a drooping limb of a beech or dogwood tree at the height
of from six to ten feet from the ground. It is never saddled on a limb
like that of a Wood Pewee, neither is it pensile like those of the Vireos,
but is built in the fork of a small limb, and securely fastened thereto by a
strip of bark. The nest itself is mostly made of fine strips of bark or weed-stalks,
woven together without much care as to neatness or strength, and so
very slight is the structure that you may often count the eggs in the nest
from below. Occasionally this bird constructs its nest of the blossoms of
the hickory-tree, and when thus made is very neat and pretty.</p>

<p>The eggs are generally three in number (Mr. Jackson has never known
more in a nest), and they are said to be of a rich cream-color, thinly spotted
near the greater end. The Cow-Bird sometimes imposes on this species
with its parasitic offspring, but not so often as upon other birds.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson also informs me that this is quite a common bird in some
localities. In one piece of woodland, half a mile east of West Chester, he
can every season meet with six or eight of their nests, while in another
direction, in a wood apparently similar in every respect, he has never met
with any.</p>

<p>Mr. J. A. Allen mentions finding this Flycatcher as a rare summer visitant
in Western Massachusetts, where, as he states, it breeds in swamps and
low moist thickets, which are its exclusive haunts. He characterizes it as one
of the most spirited and tyrannical of this genus. It is said to have a short
quick note, sounding like <i class="birdcall">quequeal</i>, which it utters hurriedly and sharply,
and to have an erect, hawk-like attitude. He adds that it is very quarrelsome
with its own species, a battle ensuing whenever two males meet.
They pursue each other fiercely, with snapping bills and sharp, querulous,
twittering notes. He found it a very shy bird, and difficult to collect, frequenting
exclusively, so far as he was able to observe, thick alder-swamps
and swampy thickets, keeping concealed among the thick bushes, or at a
great distance.</p>

<p>Wilson’s history of this species is quite brief, and he expressly states that
it is a bird but little known. His account of its nest and eggs is inaccurate,
and refers probably to that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minimus</i>, as also the statement that it
extends its migrations as far as Newfoundland. He found it inhabiting
only the deepest solitary parts of the woods, stationed among the lower
branches, uttering at short intervals a sudden, sharp squeak, heard at considerable
distance through the woods. As it flies, it utters a low, querulous
note, which it changes, on alighting, to its usual sharp cry. He adds that
it is a rare and very solitary bird, always haunting the most gloomy, moist,
and unfrequented parts of the forest, feeding on flying insects, devouring
wild bees and huckleberries in their season.</p>

<p>To this account Audubon furnishes but little additional that is reliable. He
evidently confounded with it the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minimus</i>, repeats Wilson’s description of its
<!--421.png--><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 377]</span>
eggs, and is incorrect as to its northern distribution. He speaks of it as
extremely pugnacious, chasing from its premises every intruder, and when
once mated seldom leaving the vicinity of its nest except in pursuit of
food. His description of the nest applies to that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minimus</i>, but not
to that of this species.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway writes me that in Southern Illinois it is the most abundant
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Empidonaces</i>, breeding in the same woods with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. trailli</i>. It is so
exceedingly similar to that species in manners and general habits that they
are hard to distinguish, and it requires a long acquaintance with the two
in the woods to learn to distinguish them when seen or heard. A close
attention, however, shows that the notes of the two are quite distinct.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser mentions finding this species not uncommon near San Antonio,
Texas, during the summer. Its stomach was found to contain small
insects. Dr. Woodhouse also speaks of it as common in Texas, New
Mexico, and the Indian Territory, but at what season is not mentioned.</p>

<p>Dr. Hoy writes me that this bird, quite common about Racine some
twenty-five years ago, has now almost entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>Near Washington Dr. Coues found this Flycatcher a common summer
resident, the most abundant of the kind, and the only one that breeds there
in any numbers. They arrive the last of April, and remain until the last
of September.</p>

<p>A beautiful nest of this species was found by Mr. George O. Welch near
Indianapolis, Indiana. It was fully identified, and the parent shot. This
nest has a diameter of four inches, and a height of two. Its base is composed
to a large extent of dried grasses, intermingled with masses of withered
blossoms of different herbaceous plants. Above this is constructed a
somewhat rudely interwoven nest, composed entirely of long, fine, wiry stems
of grasses. The cavity is two inches wide and less than one in depth. The
eggs, three in number, are exceedingly beautiful, and differ from all the
eggs of this genus, having more resemblance to those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Contopi</i>. They
have an elongated oval shape, and are quite pointed at one end. They
measure .78 by .56 of an inch. Their ground is a rich cream-color, tinged
with a reddish-brown shading, and at the larger end the eggs are irregularly
marked with scattered and vivid blotches of red and reddish-brown. The
nest was found on the <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> of June.</p>

<p>Specimens from the eastern regions of North and Middle America,
though varying slightly among themselves, all agree in the characters which
distinguish them from the western series.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This well-marked species was first obtained in Carlisle, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr>,
and described by the Bairds in 1843. It has since remained a comparatively
rare and scattered species, and has been only seldom met with. I found it
breeding in the vicinity of Halifax, and also among the Grand Menan
Islands, and in both cases was so fortunate as to be able to obtain its nest
and eggs. It has been found near Calais by Mr. Boardman, and its nest
also procured. It has also been found breeding near Trenton, <abbr title="New Jersey">N. J.</abbr>, by
Dr. Slack, and in a not distant locality in the same State by Dr. Abbott.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues observed the Yellow-bellied Flycatcher to be a rather rare
spring and autumnal visitant at Washington. As specimens were taken there
July 28, undoubtedly they occasionally breed there. They appear early in
May, and go south the latter part of September.</p>

<p>Two specimens of Flycatcher, identified as of this species, are recorded
by Professor Reinhardt as having been taken at Godthaab, Greenland, in
1853.</p>

<p>Sumichrast met with this species in Vera Cruz, but whether as a resident
<!--423.png--><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 379]</span>
or only as a migrant he could not determine. Mr. Dresser states that it is
common in the summer near San Antonio, arriving there in April. Dr.
Coues met it in its migrations through South Carolina. Dr. Turnbull speaks
of it as rare in the neighborhood of Philadelphia, where it arrives in the
middle of April on its way north. It has been found throughout Eastern
Mexico and Guatemala, and as far south as Panama.</p>

<p>Mr. Verrill regarded this species as a summer resident in Western Maine,
though he never met with its nest, and at no time very common. Specimens
were procured between the last of May and the middle of June. It
was found, though very rare, by Mr. McIlwraith, at Hamilton, where it was
supposed to be a summer resident. Specimens were taken about the middle
of May.</p>

<p>Dr. Hoy detected this species in the summer of 1869, in the vicinity of
Racine, and although he had no doubt that they had a nest in the vicinity,
he was not able to discover it. He was surprised to find that the male of
this species has quite a pretty song. This fact has since been confirmed by
the observations of Mr. Boardman, who has heard this bird give forth quite
a pleasing, though somewhat monotonous trill. This, according to Dr. Hoy,
resembles <i class="birdcall">Pēa-wāyk-pēa-wāyoc</i>, several times repeated in a soft and not unpleasant
call or song.</p>

<p>In Western Massachusetts Mr. Allen has found this species rather rare.
Those met with have all been taken from May 15 to June 5. Dr. Coues,
in his List of the birds of New England, expresses his conviction that this
species is probably much less rare than collectors have generally supposed.
It harbors very closely in shady woods and thickets, and is very rarely to be
met with anywhere else. In the distance it is not easily distinguished from
other species of this genus, and may have been allowed to go unsought,
mistaken for a much more common species. Mr. Allen has generally met
with quite a number each year in May, sometimes several in a single excursion.
Mr. Maynard took eight specimens in a few hours, May 31, in Eastern
Massachusetts, and Mr. Welch obtained an unusual number in a single season.
Dr. Coues has also met with them near Washington during their breeding-season.</p>

<p>At Grand Menan I found the nest of this species in a low alder-bush, on
the edge of a thicket, but within a few feet of the shore. The nest was
about two feet from the ground, placed in the fork of the bush, and bearing
a close resemblance to the nest of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cyanospiza cyanea</i>. It was loosely
made of soft strips of the inner bark of deciduous trees, and lined with
yellow stems of grasses. It was not large for the bird, but the conspicuous
color of the materials at once betrayed the nest as we chanced to land within
a few feet of it. The female immediately slid from it, and was not seen
again, but her mate was undisturbed by our presence. Afterwards other
nests were obtained at Halifax, on the edge of swampy woods, made of
stubble, and placed in low bushes. All the eggs I obtained were white, of a
<!--424.png--><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 380]</span>
slightly more chalky hue than those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minimus</i>, and more oblong. Those
procured by Mr. Boardman were sprinkled with minute dots of reddish-brown.
Their measurement is .68 by .52 of an inch.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This Flycatcher is a western form, closely allied to our eastern
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. flaviventris</i>. It was met with by Dr. Coues in Arizona, where it was
rather rare, and appeared to be a summer resident. It arrives in that
Territory about the middle of April, and remains there until the latter part
of September. Dr. Coues found it difficult to distinguish this form from
our eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flaviventris</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper obtained at Monterey, <abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>, specimens of the western types of
this bird, having darker markings on the wing, which, however, he regards
as only indicative of a young plumage, and not of specific distinctness. He
found these birds chiefly frequenting woods of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Coniferæ</i>, and very silent,
which, so far as the observation has any value, indicates a marked difference
between the eastern and the western birds.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are also different from any of the eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E.
flaviventris</i> that I have ever seen, and are more like the eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. trailli</i>
than of the other species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Empidonax</i>. They measure .73 of an inch in
length, by .58 in breadth, have a creamy-white ground, marked at the
larger end with reddish-brown and purplish markings. They are of an
oblong-oval shape. Mr. Ridgway met with this species only once in his
western explorations, when he obtained a pair in a thick pine woods on the
Wahsatch Mountains, in June. They were exceedingly retiring, and frequented
dark woods, whose solitudes were shared besides only by the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Turdus auduboni</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Myiadestes townsendi</i>. Their note was a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pit</i>, much
more like that of some Warblers than like the notes of the other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Empidonaces</i>.</p>

<p>This species, called by Mr. Grayson “The Lonely Flycatcher,” was found
<!--425.png--><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 381]</span>
by him quite common in the Three Marias, islands off the Pacific coast
of Mexico, as well as on the main coast, and also in California. The
accustomed places of resort of this solitary little bird were, he states, the
most retired and secluded dells of the forest. He there met with it beneath
the canopy of the natural and shady grottos formed by the overlapping
branches, intermingled with innumerable creeping plants, sitting upon some
low twig watching for a passing fly. At other times it might be seen
frequenting some secluded and shady little brook, near the surface of
which it often darted upon the flies that skimmed over the surface of the
water, ever and anon uttering a low and plaintive one-syllabled note.</p>

Bill very narrow. Tarsi long. Wing rounded. Second, third, and fourth
quills longest; first shorter than sixth, sometimes than seventh and eighth. Tail rounded.
Above dull brownish-olive, paler on the rump, tinged with gray on the head. Loral
region and space round the eye whitish. Throat and forepart of the breast grayish-white,
slightly tinged with olive across the latter; the rest of the under parts pale
yellowish. Wings and tail brown; the former with two conspicuous bands of brownish-white;
the outer primary edged, the secondaries and tertials edged and tipped with the
same. The outer web of the external tail-feather white, in strong contrast. Length,

1866, 63).</p>

<p>The most decided character of this species is seen in the combination
of the narrow bill and the white outer margin of the external tail-feather,
together with the long tarsi. The bill measured across opposite the middle
of the nostrils is less than half its length from the forehead, instead of
being considerably more, as in nearly all the other North American species,
except <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hammondi</i>. From this, however, the longer tail, edged externally
with white; the longer bill and tarsus, the more rounded wings, the
paler throat, etc., will distinguish it. Some specimens (spring and summer
individuals) are very pale, showing scarcely any yellow beneath; the
upper parts more tinged with gray. Sometimes there is a decidedly hoary
frontlet.</p>

16, 1868; C. King, R. Ridgway) is remarkable for its pale and unusually
grayish colors. There is nowhere any tinge of yellow, and scarcely any of
brown, the colors being simply clear ash and pure dull white, except the
dusky of wings and tail. In these respects it differs from all others in the
collection; there can be no doubt, however, that it is the same species as
the brownish individuals obtained in the same locality.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This Flycatcher appears to have been first described as a Mexican
species by Swainson in 1827. Since then it has been obtained by Sumichrast
in the Department of Vera Cruz, but whether resident or only
migratory he was unable to decide. Specimens were obtained at El Paso,
in Texas, by Mr. C. Wright, on the Mexican Boundary Survey. Dr. Coues
found this bird a summer resident in Arizona, but rare. It arrives there
early in April, and remains until October. Dr. Cooper first observed this
species at Fort Mohave about April 1, and a few afterwards until May 25.
They kept among low bushes, were generally silent, or with only a single
lisping chirp. Occasionally they flew a short distance after insects in the
general manner of this genus. We are indebted to Mr. Ridgway for all the
knowledge we possess in reference to the habits and nesting of this rare
species.</p>

<p>He met with them in all the aspen groves and thickets of the high
mountain regions, from the Sierra Nevada to the Wahsatch and Uintah
Mountains. The aspen copses at the head of the cañons of the highest
and well-watered ranges of the Great Basin were their favorite resort; but
they were sometimes seen in the “mahogany” woods on the spurs, and
occasionally, even, on the willows in the river valleys. Their common note
was a weird <i class="birdcall">sweer</i>, much like the call of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chrysomitris pinus</i>, but very often,
especially when the nest was approached, they uttered a soft liquid <i class="birdcall">whit</i>. In
the Toyabe Mountains, where these little Flycatchers were breeding abundantly
in the aspen copses, Mr. Ridgway found them to be so unsuspicious
that several were taken from the nest with his hand; and one which was
shot at and slightly wounded returned to her nest and suffered herself to
be taken off without showing any alarm.</p>

<p>A nest obtained by Mr. Ridgway near Austin, in Nevada, July 3, 1868,
was built in the crotch of a small aspen, about five feet from the ground.
This nest is a very neat, homogeneous, compact structure, cup-like in shape,
three inches in diameter, and two and a half in height. Its cavity is one
and a half inches in depth, and three inches across the rim. It is composed
almost entirely of strips of soft and bleached fragments of the inner bark
of deciduous trees and shrubs, and hempen fibres of various plants. The
inner nest is a lining made of finer materials of the same, with a few fine
roots and feathers.</p>

<p>The eggs, three in number, are of a uniform creamy white, unspotted,
and not unlike the eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Empidonax minimus</i>. They measure .73 of an
inch in length, and .60 in breadth.</p>

<p><!--427.png--><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 383]</span>
The nest and eggs of this species were also found by Mr. C. S. McCarthy,
in Dodge Valley, July 2, 1859. The nest was in a low flowering bush, and
was a few feet from the ground. It was likewise found breeding at Camp
Grant, Arizona, by Dr. Palmer.</p>

<p>In this species the olive-green on the sides is scarcely distinguishable
from that on the back, although becoming more yellow on the middle of the
breast. There is a decided ashy shade on the whole head. The only light
edging to the quills is seen on the terminal half of the secondaries. The
upper mandible and feet are black; the tip of the lower (and in one specimen
the whole) dark brown. The fork of the tail measures a quarter of an
inch in depth; the longest quill exceeds the first by .40.</p>

<p>This species is at once distinguishable from all the North American
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyrannulas</i>, except <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">obscurus</i>, by the extreme narrowness as well as shortness
of the bill. This is only .25 of an inch wide at the posterior angle of the
mouth, and only .19 at the nostrils. Its colors above are those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acadicus</i>,
while the general effect is much more that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flaviventris</i>, although less
brightly olive. The throat is grayish, not of the same yellow with the
belly; the ring round the eye white, not yellow; the olive of the breast
much more continuous and distinct; the bands on the wings dull grayish
instead of clear greenish-yellow. The tail, instead of being nearly even, is
quite deeply forked. The bill is scarcely half as wide, and brownish, not
yellow, beneath. The tarsus has the same peculiar scutellation.</p>

<p>The differences from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. obscurus</i> are less easily expressed. It is, however,
considerably smaller, and more olivaceous above and below, the tarsi very
much shorter; the most tangible character is seen in the absence of the
<!--428.png--><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 384]</span>
white on the outer web of the external tail-feather, which is only a little
paler brown than elsewhere. The abdomen is much more distinctly yellowish.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species was first discovered in the vicinity of Fort Tejon,
<abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>, by Mr. Xantus, in 1858, and described by him in the Proceedings
of the Philadelphia Academy. It has since been taken in other parts of
California and Mexico. Sumichrast found it in the Department of Vera
Cruz; and Dr. Coues has taken it in Arizona, where he regarded it as a
rather rare summer resident, arriving late in April and remaining until the
third week in October.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper obtained a single specimen of this species at Fort Mohave,
May 20. It closely resembled <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. obscurus</i> in its habits at that time, and
he mistook it for that species. He afterwards met with others, as supposed,
of these birds, on Catalina Island, in June. They kept in low trees, and
uttered a few faint lisping notes. The first of this species arrived at Santa
Cruz, March 13, and they were numerous during the summer, disappearing
in September. April 27, Dr. Cooper found the first nest. It was built on
the horizontal branch of a negundo-tree, about eighteen feet from the
ground. He found four others afterwards, from four to ten feet high, either
on horizontal branches or on forks of small trees. They contained three or
four eggs each, or young. The last one with eggs was found as late as
June 29, probably a second nest of a pair that had been robbed. These
nests were all thick walled, composed externally of dry mosses and downy
buds, with a few strips of bark and leaves, and slender woody fibres,
and often with a few hairs or feathers lining the inside. Externally the
nests were about four inches wide and two and a half high. The cavity
was two inches wide and one and a half deep. The eggs were white with
brown blotches and specks near the larger end, disposed mostly in a circle.
They measured .68 by .52 of an inch.</p>

<p>These birds, he further states, frequented only the darkest groves along
the river, and had a very few simple call-notes of a monotonous character.
They were so very shy that he could not get near enough to determine
the species, which in all probability was not this species, but the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. pusillus</i>.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. hammondi</i> was met with by Mr. Ridgway only in the East Humboldt
Mountains, where, in September, it was found in the thickest groves
of tall aspens. It seemed to be confined to these localities, and was much
more secluded than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. obscurus</i>. Its common note was a soft <i class="birdcall">pit</i>.</p>

<p>A number of nests and eggs sent, with the parent birds, from Lesser Slave
Lake, by Mr. Strachan Jones, show that its eggs are unspotted creamy-white,
like those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. minimus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E. obscurus</i>. Indeed, a number of nests
and eggs of the former of these two species, also accompanied by the parent
birds, could not be distinguished, except by their apparently just appreciably
larger size, on the average.</p>

and sulphur-yellow. Head crested; bristles of gape
reaching nearly to tip of bill. Feet very weak.</p>

<p>The type of this genus (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. phæocercus</i>)
is quite different in form from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Empidonax</i>,
the nearest North American ally, but both
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. pallescens</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fulvifrons</i> could with little
violence be placed in it. There is no positive
character to separate the latter from
the average of species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Empidonax</i>, except
it be the color. The crest is not at all conspicuous, nor is there any
appreciable difference of form; while in the form of the bill these species
are much nearer <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Empidonax</i> than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mitrephorus</i>. The legs, however, are
weaker, and the rictal bristles longer.</p>

<p>The true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. fulvifrons</i> of Mexico differs simply in deeper colors, the
shade above being decidedly fulvous, instead of grayish, and the lower parts
much more deeply ochraceous, the abdomen not approaching white; the
wing-markings are also tinged with ochraceous.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species, both new to our fauna and previously undescribed,
was taken by Dr. Coues at Fort Whipple. It belongs to a newly established
genus of Flycatchers, recently established by Mr. Sclater, similar to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Empidonax</i>.
So far as known, its members are more or less tropical in their residence.
It is a rare summer resident at Fort Whipple, arriving there early
in May. Nothing is stated in reference to its habits, except that they correspond
with those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Empidonaces</i>.</p>

<p>Every stage between the youngest plumage described and the adult male
may be found in a large series of immature specimens: the shade of the red
in both sexes frequently varies, it being
sometimes of a slightly rosaceous tint,
and again decidedly inclining to orange;
its amount in the female varies almost
with the individual. The two South
American races (<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nanus</i> and <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rubineus</i>;
see synopsis) differ in having the
brown of upper parts, etc., very decidedly
darker; no appreciable light edgings to
wing-feathers, and sometimes an appreciably
more intense red. One of
them (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nanus</i>) has a distinct white outer edge to lateral tail-feather, and
slight whitish tips to the other; the other has no more than a trace of
these markings.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This brilliant species is a rare summer visitant to Texas, New
Mexico, Arizona, and probably Southern California. It is found throughout
Middle America. It has only within a few years been known as a resident
within our territory, but was first observed in Texas by Captain McCown, of
the United States Army, in 1850, and its claim to a place in our fauna
publicly made by Mr. G. N. Lawrence. Captain McCown, in some notes on
the habits of certain Texan birds, published in the Annals of the <abbr title="New York"><span class="sc">N. Y.</span></abbr>
Lyceum, speaks of this Flycatcher as being seldom seen, and of his having
noticed not more than a dozen in Western Texas. He always found them
near ponds of water, in the vicinity of the Rio Grande, generally on a tree
or a stake near the water. He only met with one nest, and this was inaccessible.
It was built on an acacia over the water.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Couch, in a letter to Mr. Cassin, states that he first met with
this bird at Charco Escondido, in Tamaulipas, on the 10th of March. The
males had come in advance of the females, as the latter were not observed
until several weeks afterwards. Early in the morning, and again about sunset,
one of these birds came to the artificial lake constructed there for the supply
of water to the inhabitants. It appeared to be of a very quiet and inoffensive
disposition, usually sitting on the upper branches of the trees, occasionally
uttering a low chirp. He subsequently met with these birds in Nueva
<!--433.png--><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 389]</span>
Leon. In their habits they appeared to be in some respects similar to the
smaller northern Flycatchers.</p>

<p>Dr. Henry also met with these birds in the vicinity of Fort Webster, in
New Mexico; he found them exceedingly rare, and his observations were
confirmatory of their partiality for the neighborhood of water. His first
specimen was obtained on the Rio Mimbres, near Fort Webster, in the
month of March.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse met with an individual of this Flycatcher near the settlement
of Quihi, in Texas, in the month of May. It was breeding in a thicket.
He did not hear it utter any note.</p>

<p>According to the observations of Mr. Sumichrast, this bird is very
abundant throughout the entire Department of Vera Cruz, common everywhere,
at all heights, in the hot, the temperate, and the alpine regions. Mr.
Dresser obtained a fine male specimen from the San Pedro River, near San
Antonio, in August. Another, a young male, was obtained September 25.
It was very shy, and made its way through the low bushes like the Hedge
Sparrow of Europe. A third was obtained April 5, after much difficulty.
It was not so shy as the others, but kept more in the open country, always
perching on some elevated place. Its note resembled that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Milvulus
forficatus</i>.</p>

<p>This bird, according to Dr. Coues, is not found as far to the north as Fort
Whipple, among the mountains, though it extends up the valley of the
Colorado to an equally high latitude. It is also said to be common in the
valley of the Gila and in Southern Arizona generally.</p>

<p>Mr. E. C. Taylor (Ibis, <abbr title="Six">VI</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 86) mentions finding this Flycatcher tolerably
abundant both at Ciudad Bolivar and at Barcelona, but he did not meet
with a specimen on the island of Trinidad. He notes its great resemblance
in habits to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Muscicapæ</i> of Europe.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly reports that these birds were often observed by him at
various points on the road, from Boca Grande to Los Nogales. It generally
selected its perch on the topmost branch of some bush or tree, awaiting the
approach of its insect food, and then sallying out to capture it. Sometimes
it poised itself in a graceful manner in the air, while its bright plumage
glistened in the sun like some brightly colored flower.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann procured a specimen of this Flycatcher at Fort Yuma,
where he was informed that it was quite common in spring. He saw other
individuals of this species at Tucson in Sonora. These birds, he states,
station themselves upon the topmost branches of trees, and when pursued
appear quite wild, flying to a considerable distance before again alighting.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper saw at Fort Mohave, May 24, a bird which he had no doubt
was an individual of this species, but he was not able to procure it. It
perched upon the tops of bushes, and would not suffer him to approach within
shooting distance. One has since been taken by Mr. W. W. Holden in
Colorado Valley, <abbr title="latitude">lat.</abbr> 34<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, April 18.</p>

<p><!--434.png--><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 390]</span>
Mr. Joseph Leyland found this species common on the flats near Peten,
in Guatemala, as also on the pine ridges of Belize. They have, he states,
a singular habit of spinning round and round on the wing, and then
dropping suddenly with wings loose and fluttering as though shot,&mdash;apparently
done for amusement. They lay three or four light-colored eggs
in a small nest composed of light grass and lined with cottony materials.
Mr. Xantus found the nest and eggs of this species at San José, Mexico,
May 16, 1861.</p>

<p class="small">
<abbr title="Characteristics"><span class="sc">Char.</span></abbr> Head large; bill long, strong, straight, and sub-pyramidal, usually longer than
the head. Tongue very small. Wings short; legs small; the outer and middle toes
united to their middle. Toes with the usual number of joints (2, 3, 4, 5).</p>

<p>The gape of the bill in the Kingfishers is large, reaching to beneath the
eyes. The third primary is generally longest; the first decidedly shorter;
the secondaries vary from twelve to fifteen in number, all nearly equal.
The secondaries cover at least three quarters of the wing. The tail is short,
the feathers twelve in number; they are rather narrow, the outer usually
shorter. The lower part of the tibia is bare, leaving the joint and the tarsus
uncovered. The tarsus is covered anteriorly with plates; behind, it is
shagreen-like or granulated. The hind toe is connected with the inner, so
as to form with it and the others a regular sole, which extends unbroken
beneath the middle and outer as far as the latter are united. The inner toe
is much shorter than the outer. The claws are sharp; the middle expanded
on its inner edge, but not pectinated.</p>

<p>This species varies considerably in size with locality, as do so many
others. Western specimens are appreciably larger, especially those from the
northwest coast. According to Nuttall and Audubon, it is the female that
has the transverse band of chestnut across the belly. In this they may be
correct; but several specimens in the Smithsonian collection marked female
(perhaps erroneously) show no indication of the chestnut.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_101" id="fnanchor_101"></a><a href="#footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Two closely allied but much larger species belong to Middle and South
America. They differ in having the whole body beneath of a reddish
color.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Belted Kingfisher of North America is a widely
distributed species at all times, and in the summer is found in every portion
of North America, to the Arctic Ocean on the north, and from the Atlantic
to the Pacific. It is more or less resident throughout the year, and in
mild and open winters a few have been known to linger throughout New
England, and even in higher latitudes. In 1857 Captain Blakiston found
it remaining on the lower part of the Saskatchewan River until the 7th
of October; and afterwards, in 1859, at Pembina, on the 1st of May, he observed
<!--440.png--><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 394]</span>
them to be present, although the river was not yet open. Those
that have migrated to the south make their reappearance in spring throughout
the continent as soon as, and not unfrequently before, the ice has disappeared
from the rivers and ponds.</p>

<p>It occurs in extreme northern latitudes. Mr. MacFarlane received skins
from the Eskimos obtained on the Arctic coast, and Mr. Dall found them
breeding at Fort Yukon, where it was quite common on all the small streams
flowing into that river. It was also found by Dr. Richardson frequenting
all the large streams of the fur countries, as far at least as the 67th parallel.
In California a larger race than our Atlantic species is found abundantly
along the coast, and about nearly every stream or lake in which the water
is not turbid and muddy.</p>

<p>Mr. A. Newton reports this bird as a winter visitant at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix, leaving
the island late in April. It frequents mangrove swamps and the mouths
of small streams, sometimes fishing half a mile out at sea. The stomach of
one contained shells of crabs. The occurrence of two specimens of this
species in Ireland is recorded by Mr. Thompson.</p>

<p>The Kingfisher is an eminently unsocial species. It is never found other
than in solitary pairs, and these are very rarely seen together. They feed
almost entirely upon fish, which they capture by plunging into the water,
and which they always swallow whole on emerging from their bath. Undigested
portions of their food, such as scales, bones, etc., they have the
power of occasionally ejecting from their stomachs. They may usually be
noticed by the side of streams, mill-ponds, and lakes, stationed on some convenient
position that enables them to overlook a deep place suitable for
their purpose, and they rarely make a plunge without accomplishing their
object.</p>

<p>The cry of the Kingfisher, uttered when he is disturbed, or when moving
from place to place, and occasionally just as he is about to make a plunge,
is loud and harsh, and resembles the noise made by a watchman’s rattle.
This noise he makes repeatedly at all hours, and most especially at night,
during the breeding-season, whenever he returns to the nest with food for
his mate or young.</p>

<p>They nest in deep holes excavated by themselves in the sides of streams,
ponds, or cliffs, not always in the immediate vicinity of water. These excavations
are often near their accustomed fishing-grounds, in some neighboring
bank, usually not many feet from the ground, always in dry gravel, and
sufficiently high to be in no danger of inundation. They make their
burrow with great industry and rapidity, relieving one another from time
to time, and working incessantly until the result is satisfactorily accomplished.
When digging through a soft fine sand-bank their progress is
surprising, sometimes making a deep excavation in a single night. The
pages of “The American Naturalist” contain several animated controversies
as to the depth, the shape, and the equipments of these passages.
<!--441.png--><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 395]</span>
The result of the evidence thus given seems to be that the holes the
Kingfishers make are not less than four nor more than fifteen feet in
length; that some are perfectly straight, while some, just before their
termination, turn to the right, and others to the left; and that all have,
at or near the terminus, an enlarged space in which the eggs are deposited.
Here the eggs are usually laid on the bare sand, there being very rarely, if
ever, any attempt to construct a nest. The use of hay, dry grass, and feathers,
spoken of by the older writers, does not appear to be confirmed by more
recent testimony. Yet it is quite possible that in certain situations the use
of dry materials may be resorted to to protect the eggs from a too damp
soil.</p>

<p>The place chosen for the excavation is not always near water. In the
spring of 1855 I found the nest of a Kingfisher in a bank by the side of the
carriage path on Mount Washington, more than a mile from any water. It
was a shallow excavation, made that season, and contained fresh eggs the
latter part of May. The food of the pair was taken near the dam of a sawmill
on Peabody River. In another instance a pair of Kingfishers made
their abode in a sand-bank in the midst of the village of Hingham, within
two rods of the main street, and within a few feet of a dwelling, and not in
the near vicinity of water. Here the confidence they displayed was not
misplaced. They were protected, and their singular habits carefully and
curiously watched. During the day they were cautious, reticent, and rarely
seen, but during the night they seemed to be passing back and forth continually,
the return of each parent being announced by a loud rattling cry.
Later in the season, when the young required constant attention, these nocturnal
noises seemed nearly incessant, and became almost a nuisance to the
family.</p>

<p>The Kingfisher, having once selected a situation for its nest, is very
tenacious of it, and rarely forsakes it unless compelled to by too great
annoyances. They will submit to be robbed time after time, and still
return to the same spot and renew their attempts. They are devoted to
their young, exhibit great solicitude if their safety is threatened, and will
suffer themselves to be taken from their nest rather than leave it, and
immediately return to it again.</p>

<p>Mr. Dall observed a male bird of this species digging other holes in the
bank near his nest, apparently for amusement or occupation. They were
never more than two feet in length and about eight inches in diameter. He
seemed to abandon them as soon as made, though seen to retire into one to
eat a fish he had captured.</p>

<p>The eggs are usually six, rarely seven, in number, and are of a beautifully
clear crystal whiteness. They are very nearly spherical in shape, and measure
1.31 by 1.06 inches.</p>

<p>This species is much smaller than the Northern or Belted Kingfisher, and
is easily distinguishable by the diagnostic marks already given. The sexes
appear to differ, like those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. alcyon</i>, namely, the female being distinguished
by a rufous pectoral band, which is wanting in the male.</p>

<p>Tschudi and Cabanis separate the northern from the more southern bird
under the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. cabanisi</i>; Tschudi retaining the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. americana</i>
for specimens resident in eastern South America. The differences are
said to consist in the larger size, longer bill, greater extension of the white
of the throat, and the decided spotting on the wing-coverts and quills of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cabanisi</i>. Though these differences are readily appreciable, they correspond
so entirely with natural laws, distinguishing northern and southern individuals
of most resident species, that it is only fair to consider them as
merely modifications of a single species.</p>

<p>Several other species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chloroceryle</i> proper are found in Tropical America.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> So far as is certainly known, this species is only found within
our fauna as a bird of Texas, where it is occasional, rather than common, and
confined to its western limits. From information received, I am confident
that it will yet become known as at least of rare occurrence in Southern
Florida, and possibly along the whole gulf coast. It was first noticed as a
bird of the United States by Captain McCown, and added to our list by
Mr. Lawrence, in 1851. It has since then been occasionally taken near the
Rio Grande and in all the northeastern portions of Mexico. It is said to
be found nearly throughout Mexico, and to be abundant also in Central
America.</p>

<p><!--443.png--><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 397]</span>
Mr. Dresser noticed several of these birds at Matamoras, in August, and
afterwards found them common on the Nueces and the Leona Rivers, in
which places they were breeding. In December he saw others near Eagle
Pass. They were nowhere so abundant as the common belted species.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues states that they have been observed on several points on the
Colorado River between Fort Mohave and Fort Yuma,&mdash;the only instances
of their occurrence in the United States other than on the Rio Grande. We
have but little information in regard to their habits, but there is no reason
to suppose that they differ in this respect.</p>

<p>Mr. Salvin states that this species occurs abundantly everywhere upon
the small streams in the Atlantic coast region, and in the interior of Central
America. It was frequently observed near Dueñas, both on the Guacalate
and on the outlet of Lake Dueñas. And Mr. J. F. Hamilton, in his
Notes on the birds from the province of Santo Paulo, in Brazil, states that
he found this species several times in the vicinity of shallow pools, most
especially those of which the banks were well wooded. Several times he
saw them perched on logs projecting a few feet out of the water. Dr. Burmeister
speaks of this bird (<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">americana</i>) as the most common species
of Kingfisher in Brazil. It is there met with everywhere near the small
brooks, on the overhanging branches, and plunging into the water after its
prey, which consists especially of small fish. It is less shy than other
species, coming quite near to the settlements and being easily shot. Its
nest is found in holes in the banks.</p>

<p>Mr. E. C. Taylor also mentions finding this species pretty common in the
island of Trinidad, especially among the mangroves in the swamps and
lagoons.</p>

<p>Eggs marked as those of Kingfishers were found in the collection of the
late Dr. Berlandier, of Matamoras, and are presumed to belong to this
species, though no notes in relation to their parentage, and none referring
to this bird, were found among his papers. Except in size, they closely
resembled eggs of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. alcyon</i>, being of a pure bright crystal-white color,
and measuring 1.06 inches in length by .61 in breadth.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Characteristics"><span class="sc">Char.</span></abbr>
Bill very short; the gape enormously long and wide, opening to beneath or
behind the eyes. Culmen variable. Toes connected by a movable skin; secondaries
lengthened; plumage soft, sometimes very full and loose, as in the Owls.</p>

<p>The preceding diagnosis in connection with that of the order will suffice
to separate the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caprimulgidæ</i> from their allies. Their closest relatives are
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cypselidæ</i>, next to which perhaps may be reckoned the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trochilidæ</i>.</p>

<p>In defining the subdivisions of this family, we make use of an excellent
monograph of the American species by Dr. Sclater, in Proceedings of the
Zoölogical Society, London, 1866, 123. He establishes three subfamilies as
follows:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Dr. Sclater is of the opinion that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Podargus</i> may ultimately have to be
placed in a different family from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caprimulgidæ</i>, with or without the
other genera placed under <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Podarginæ</i>; of these <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nyctibius</i>, the sole New

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Night-Hawk of North America is a very common
species throughout a widely extended area, and within the United States
breeds wherever found. Its range extends from Florida and Texas to the
extreme northern latitudes, and from the Atlantic at least to the great Central
Plains. It has been found as far to the south as Panama.</p>

<p>At Matamoras Mr. Dresser found this species abundant during the summer
<!--448.png--><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 402]</span>
season, and towards dusk thousands of these birds and of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. texensis</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. henryi</i> might be seen flying in towards the river from the prairies,
this one being the least common of the three. In Northern Florida it is
also a common species, and I have rarely received any collection of eggs
from that State without the eggs of this bird being found among them.
They are known there as Bull-bats.</p>

<p>In many of its habits, as well as in its well-marked generic distinctions,
this species exhibits so many and such well-marked differences from the
Whippoorwill that there seem to be no good reasons for confounding two
birds so very unlike. It is especially much less nocturnal, and has, strictly
speaking, no claim to its common name, as indicating it to be a bird of the
night, which it is not. It is crepuscular, rather than nocturnal, and even
this habit is more due to the flight of the insects upon which it feeds at
morning and at evening than to any organization of the bird rendering it
necessary. It may not unfrequently be seen on the wing, even in bright
sunny weather, at midday, in pursuit of its winged prey. This is especially
noticeable with such birds as are wont to frequent our large cities, which may
be seen throughout all hours of the day sailing high in the air. Generally,
however, it is most lively early in the morning and just before nightfall,
when its supply of insect food is most abundant. But it is never to be
found on the wing after dark. As soon as the twilight deepens into the
shades of night all retire to rest as regularly, if not at quite as early an
hour, as other birds in regard to the diurnal habits of which there is no
question.</p>

<p>This species appears to be equally abundant throughout the fur countries,
where, Dr. Richardson states, few birds are better known. In the higher
latitudes to which these birds resort the sun does not set during their stay,
and all their pursuit of insects must be made by sunlight.</p>

<p>In the winter this species leaves the United States, retiring to Mexico,
Central America, and the northern portions of South America. Specimens
from Mexico were in the Rivoli collection. They were taken by Barruel
in Nicaragua, by Salvin in Guatemala, in Jamaica by Gosse, and in Cuba by
both Lembeye and Gundlach.</p>

<p>The movements, evolutions, and general habits of this species, in the pursuit
of their prey, bear little resemblance to those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antrostomi</i>, but
are much more like those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Falconidæ</i>. They fly high in the air, often
so high as to be hardly visible, and traverse the air, moving backward and
forward in the manner of a Hawk. At times they remain perfectly stationary
for several moments, and then suddenly and rapidly dart off, their wings
causing a very peculiar vibratory sound. As they fly they utter a very loud
and shrill cry which it is almost impossible to describe, but often appearing
to come from close at hand when the bird is high in the air. Richardson
compares this sound to the vibration of a tense cord in a violent gust of
wind.</p>

<p><!--449.png--><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 403]</span>
In some of the peculiarities of its breeding the Mosquito-Hawk displays
several very marked variations of habit from the Whippoorwill. While
the latter always deposits its eggs under the cover of shady trees and in
thick woods, these birds select an open rock, a barren heath, or an exposed
hillside for their breeding-place. This is not unfrequently in wild spots in the
vicinity of a wood, but is always open to the sun. I have even known the
eggs carelessly dropped on the bare ground in a corner of a potato-field, and
have found the female sitting on her eggs in all the bright glare of a noonday
sun in June, and to all appearance undisturbed by its brilliance. A
more common situation for the eggs is a slight hollow of a bare rock, the
dark weather-beaten shades of which, with its brown and slate-colored
mosses and lichens, resembling both the parent and the egg in their coloring,
are well adapted to screen them from observation or detection.</p>

<p>The great abundance of insect life of certain kinds in the vicinity of our
large cities has of late years attracted these birds. Each summer their
number in Boston has perceptibly increased, and through June and July,
at almost all hours of the day, most especially in the afternoon, they may
be seen or heard sailing high in the air over its crowded streets. The
modern style of house-building, with flat Mansard roofs, has also added to
the inducements, affording safe and convenient shelter to the birds at night,
and serving also for the deposition of their eggs. In quite a number of instances
in the summers of 1870 and 1871 they were known to lay their
eggs and to rear their young on the flat roofs of houses in the southern and
western sections of the city. I have also been informed by the late Mr.
Turnbull, of Philadelphia, that the flat roofs of large warehouses near the
river in that city are made similar use of.</p>

<p>If approached when sitting on her eggs, the female will suffer herself to
be almost trodden on before she will leave them, and when she does it is
only to tumble at the feet of the intruder and endeavor to draw him away
from her treasures by well-feigned lameness and pretended disability. Her
imitation of a wounded bird is so perfect as to deceive almost any one not
aware of her cunning devices.</p>

<p>The eggs of this bird are always two in number, elliptical in shape,
and equally obtuse at either end. They exhibit marked variations in size,
in ground-color, and in the shades and number of their markings. In certain
characteristics and in their general effect they are alike, and all resemble
oblong-oval dark-colored pebble-stones. Their safety in the exposed
positions in which they are laid is increased by this resemblance to the
stones among which they lie. They vary in length from 1.30 to 1.13 inches,
and in breadth from .84 to .94 of an inch. Their ground is of various
shades of stone-color, in some of a dirty white, in others with a tinge of
yellow or blue, and in yet others a clay-color. The markings are more or
less diffused over the entire egg, and differ more or less with each specimen,
the prevailing colors being varying shades of slate and of yellowish-brown.
<!--450.png--><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 404]</span>
With all these variations the eggs are readily recognizable, and bear no resemblance
to any others except those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">texensis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">henryi</i>. From the
former they are easily distinguished by the greater size, but from the latter
they can only be separated by considerations of locality.</p>

<p>In examining a large series of Night-Hawks, we find the differences indicated
above, in specimens from the Black Hills, Rocky Mountains, and the
adjacent regions, to be quite decided and constant. Skins, however, from
Washington, Oregon, and California, seem darker even than the typical
eastern. There is no prominent difference beyond the lighter colors of male,
and greater distinctness, extent, and purity of the white or light markings,
and in the white patches of wing and tail, crossing the outer webs of all the
feathers; the general proportions and pattern of coloration being quite the
same. It will therefore seem proper to consider <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. henryi</i> as a local race,
characteristic of the region in which it occurs, and as such noteworthy,
but not entitled to independent rank.</p>

<p>Another race, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. minor</i>, <abbr title="Cabanis">Cab.</abbr>, similar to <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">popetue</i>, but considerably
smaller (7.50, wing, 7.00), is resident in Cuba and Jamaica. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. popetue</i> is
also said to breed in the latter island, but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minor</i> is probably referred to.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This form, whether we regard it as a good species, or only a
western race of the common Night-Hawk, was first described as a new variety
by Mr. Cassin, in 1855, from specimens procured at Fort Webster,
New Mexico, by Dr. Henry, in honor of whom it was named. Its claim to
be considered a distinct race or species rests chiefly upon its constantly different
colorations.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper, who regarded this form not specifically distinct from the Night-Hawk,
states that it is not found near the coast border of California.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly encountered it in abundance in the vicinity of Los Nogales,
in Sonora, in June. Late in the afternoon they came in great numbers
around the camp. They kept circling round and round, and approached the
earth nearer and nearer with the declining sun.</p>

texensis</i>, he never procured a single specimen of this bird, nor did Dr. Heermann
ever meet with one there.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues says these birds are abundant throughout the Territory of
Arizona. At Fort Whipple it is a summer resident, arriving in April
and remaining until October, being particularly numerous in August and
September. Mr. Drexler made a large collection of these birds at Fort
Bridger, in Utah, all of which showed such constant differences from eastern
specimens as to indicate in his opinion the propriety of a specific
separation.</p>

<p>An egg of this bird taken at Fort Crook, California, by Lieutenant Fulner,
measures 1.25 inches in length by .92 of an inch in breadth. While resembling
in general effect an egg of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. popetue</i>, it is lighter in colorings, and
varies from any of that bird I have ever seen. Its ground-color is that of
clay, over which are diffused curious aggregations of small spots and cloudings
of yellowish-brown, mingled with lilac. These markings are quite
small and separate, but are grouped in such close proximity into several
collections as to give them the appearance of large blotches; and the blending
of these two shades is so general as to produce the effect of a color
quite different from either, except upon a close inspection, or an examination
through a magnifying glass.</p>

<p>This variety was met with at the Forks of the Saskatchewan, in June,
1858, by Captain Blakiston, and specimens were obtained on the Saskatchewan
Plains, by <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Bourgeau, in the summer of the same year. The latter
also procured its eggs. These are said to have been three in number, described
as light olive, blotched with black more thickly at one end than
the other. No mention of shape is made. This description, incomplete as
it is, indicates a great dissimilarity with eggs of this bird, fully identified in
the Smithsonian collection.</p>

<p>The western variety was met with by Mr. Ridgway throughout the entire
extent of his route across the Great Basin. It bred everywhere, laying its
eggs on the bare ground, beneath a sage-bush, usually on the foot-hills of
the mountains, or on the mesas. In August and September they congregate
in immense flocks, appearing in the evening. Not the slightest difference
in habits, manners, or notes, was observed between this and the eastern
Night-Hawk.</p>

<p>The markings of this species are quite different from those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chordeiles
popetue</i>. In average specimens the prevailing color above may be described
as a mixed gray, yellowish-rusty, black, and brown, in varied but very fine
mottlings. The top of the head is rather uniformly brown, with a few
mottlings of grayish-rusty, although the concealed portion of the feathers is
much varied. On the nape is a finely mottled collar of grayish and black,
not very conspicuously defined, and rather interrupted on the median line.
A similar collar is seen on the forepart of the breast. The middle of the
back and the rump exhibit a coarser mottling of the same without any
rufous. The scapulars and wing-coverts are beautifully variegated, much as
in some of the Waders, the pattern very irregular and scarcely capable of
definition. There are, however, a good many large round spots of pale
yellowish-rusty, very conspicuous among the other markings. There is
quite a large blotch of white on the wing, situated considerably nearer the
tip than the carpal joint. It only involves four primaries, and extends
across both outer and inner webs. The four first primaries anterior to the
white blotches, and the remaining ones nearly from their tips, exhibit a
series of large round rufous spots not seen in the other North American
species. The other wing-quills have also similar markings. There is a
large V-shaped white mark on the throat, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. virginianus</i>, though rather
larger proportionally. Posterior to this there are some rather conspicuous
blotches of rufous, behind which is the obscure finely mottled collar of gray
and brown already referred to. The breast and remaining under parts are
dull white transversely banded with brown, with a strong tinge of yellowish-rufous
on the abdomen, about the vent, and on the under tail-coverts. The
tail is dark brown with about eight transverse bars of lighter; the last are
<!--453.png--><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 407]</span>
white, and extend across both vanes; the others less continuous, and yellowish-rufous
beneath as well as above, especially on the inner vane.</p>

<p>The females are quite similar, but lack the white patch of the tail, have
more numerous rufous spots on quills, and are perhaps more fulvous in
general appearance. Young birds, however, would hardly be recognized as
the same, except when taken with adults, owing to the predominance of a
pale cinnamon shade above, and a decided tinge of the same on all the
white and gray markings. Nearly all the primaries have a border of this
color.</p>

<p>The variety <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">acutipennis</i> of South America (see synopsis) is very similar,
differing merely in smaller dimensions.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Texan Night-Hawk occurs in the valley of the Rio Grande
from Texas on the east, through New Mexico, Arizona, Southern California,
and Cape San Lucas. It is found in the northern provinces of Mexico during
the summer months, and thence southward to Central America. It was
found at Dueñas, in Guatemala, by Mr. Salvin, and also at Coban. Mr.
Xantus found it breeding at Cape San Lucas in May.</p>

<p>This species was first added to our fauna by Mr. Lawrence, in 1851, as a
bird of Texas, supposed to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. brasilianus</i>, and in 1856 described by the
same writer as a new species.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Cooper, it makes its first appearance at Fort Mohave by
the 17th of April, and soon after becomes quite numerous, hunting in companies
after sunset, and hiding during the day on the ground under low
bushes. By the 25th of May they had all paired, but continued nearly
silent, making only a low croaking when approached. They flew in the
manner of the common species, but seemed to sail in rather smaller circles.
Dr. Cooper found them as far west as the Coast Mountains.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues states that this species is common in the Colorado Valley, even
farther north than the latitude of Fort Whipple. It was not, however, met
with by him at that port, nor indeed for some fifty miles to the south of it,
and then only in the summer. He adds that it extends from the Rio
Grande Valley westward to the Pacific. It was found abundant at Cape
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas by Dr. Xantus.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser found it very common at Matamoras during the summer season,
and thence to San Antonio and to the eastward of that place. At San
Antonio, in the spring, he first noticed them on the <abbr title="second">2d</abbr> of May, when he
saw seven or eight flying about at noonday. A few days later they had become
very numerous. They remained about San Antonio until the end of
September, and soon after disappeared. He noticed none later than the first
week in October.</p>

<p>Mr. J. H. Clark met with this species at Ringgold Barracks, Texas, in
June. They were to be seen sitting about in the heat of the day, at which
time they could be easily approached. During the hottest days they did not
sally forth in quest of food until late in the evening. On one occasion, near
<!--454.png--><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 408]</span>
El Paso, Mr. Clark saw these birds congregated in such quantities over a
mud-hole from which were issuing myriads of insects, that he felt that the
discharge among them of mustard-seed shot would involve a wanton destruction.
This species is not known, according to his account, to make a swoop
in the manner of the common species. It does not utter the same hoarse
sounds, nor does it ever fly so high.</p>

<p>Among the notes of the late Dr. Berlandier, of Matamoras, we find references
to this species, to which he gives the common name of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pauraque</i>, and
in his collection of eggs are many that unquestionably are those of this
bird, and which are, in all respects but size, in close affinity to the eggs of
the common Night-Hawk. These eggs measure 1.18 inches in length by
.87 of an inch in breadth. Their ground-color, seen through a magnifying
glass, is of clear crystal whiteness, but is so closely covered by overlaying
markings as not to be discernible to the eye. They are marked over the entire
surface with small irregular confluent spots and blotches, which are a blending
of black, umber, and purplish-gray markings. These combinations give
to the egg the appearance of a piece of polished marble of a dark gray color.
They are both smaller and of a lighter color than those of the common
eastern bird.</p>

appear to be the nearest relatives of this species, agreeing very closely in
coloration; but both have the rictal bristles simple, without lateral filaments,
and would thus seem to be distinct species. In the latter, the white spaces
of the tail are found only on the second and third feathers, instead of on the
outer three, while the former is said to have no such markings at all.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The exact extent of the geographical range of this species is
not very clearly defined. Rarely anywhere a very abundant species, it is
more common throughout Florida than in any other State. It is also found,
more or less frequently, in the States of Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama,
Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. Dr. Woodhouse mentions finding it
common in the Creek and Cherokee countries of the Indian Territory, and
also extending into Texas and New Mexico. Mr. Dresser noticed several
of this species on the Medina River, in Texas, April 28, and afterwards
in May. On the 18th of the same month he again found it very numerous
at New Braunfels, and also, on the 20th, at Bastrop. Dr. Heermann states
that these birds visit the neighborhood of San Antonio in the spring, and
remain there to raise their young.</p>

<p>James River, Virginia, has been assigned as the extreme northern limit
of its migrations, but I can find no evidence of its occurring so far north,
except as an accidental visitant. Wilson, indeed, claims to have met with
it between Richmond and Petersburg, and also on the Cumberland River.
Dr. Bachman states that it is not a common bird even in the neighborhood
of Charleston. Mr. Audubon, who claimed to be a very close and careful
observer of the habits of this species, states that it is seldom to be met
with beyond the then southern limits of the Choctaw nation, in Mississippi,
or the Carolinas on the Atlantic coast.</p>

<p>I have been informed by Dr. Kollock that these birds are rather common
at Cheraw, in the northern part of South Carolina. Dr. Bryant found them
quite abundant near Indian River, in Florida, though he makes no mention
of them in his paper on the birds of that State. Mr. Cassin informed me
that Colonel McCall met with this bird in New Mexico. Lembeye includes
it among the birds of Cuba, but in reality refers to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cubanensis</i>.</p>

<p>These birds, according to Mr. Audubon, are not residents, but make their
appearance within the United States about the middle of March. They are
nocturnal in their habits, remaining silent and keeping within the shady recesses
of the forests during the daytime. As soon as the sun has disappeared
and the night insects are in motion, this species issues forth from its
retreat, and begins to give utterance to the peculiar cries from which it
receives its trivial name, and which are said to resemble the syllables <i class="birdcall">chuck-wills-wi-dow</i>.
These sounds are said to be repeated with great rapidity, yet
with clearness and power, six or seven times in as many seconds. They are
only uttered for a brief period in the early evening.</p>

<p><!--460.png--><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 412]</span>
Mr. Audubon states that deep ravines, shady swamps, and extensive pine
groves, are resorted to by this species for safety during the day, and for food
during the night. Their notes are seldom heard in cloudy weather, and
never during rain. They roost in hollow trees, standing as well as prostrate,
which they never leave by day except during incubation. He adds that
whenever he has surprised them in such situations they never attempt to
make their escape by flying out, but draw back to the farthest corner, ruffle
their feathers, open their mouths to the fullest extent, and utter a hissing
sound. When taken to the light, they open and close their eyes in rapid
succession, snap their bills in the manner of a Flycatcher, and attempt to
shuffle off. When given their liberty, they fly straight forward until quite
out of sight, readily passing between the trees in their course.</p>

<p>The flight of this bird is light, like that of the Whippoorwill, and even
more elevated and graceful. It is performed by easy flapping of the wings,
with occasional sailings and curving sweeps. It sweeps, at night, over
the open fields, ascending, descending, or sailing with graceful motions in
pursuit of night beetles, moths, and other insects, repeatedly passing and
repassing over the same area, and occasionally alighting on the ground to
capture its prey. Occasionally it pauses to alight on a stake or a tall plant,
and again utters its peculiar refrain, and then resumes its search for insects.
And thus it passes pleasant summer nights.</p>

<p>Like all the birds of this family, the Chuck-will’s Widow makes no nest,
but deposits her eggs on the ground, often among a collection of dry deciduous
leaves, in the forest. These are two in number, and the spot chosen for
them are thickets, and the darker and more solitary portions of woods. Dr.
Bryant, who took several of their eggs in Florida, informed me that they
were in each instance found deposited on beds of dry leaves, but with no
attempt at any nest, and always in thick woods.</p>

<p>Sometimes, Mr. Audubon thinks, the parent bird scratches a small space
on the ground, among the leaves, before she deposits her eggs. If either
their eggs or their young are meddled with, these birds are sure to take the
alarm and transport them to some distant part of the forest. In this both
parents take part. After this removal Mr. Audubon found it impossible,
even with the aid of a dog, to find them again. On one occasion he actually
witnessed the act of removal of the eggs, and presumed that they also
treat the young in the same manner when they are quite small. The eggs
were carried off in the capacious mouths of these birds, each parent taking
one and flying off, skimming closely to the ground until lost to sight among
the branches and the trees. To what distance they were carried he was
unable to ascertain.</p>

<p>During the period of incubation they are silent, and do not repeat their
peculiar cries until just before they are preparing to depart on their southern
migrations, in August.</p>

<p>The food of these birds consists chiefly, if not altogether, of the larger
<!--461.png--><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 413]</span>
nocturnal insects, for swallowing which their mouths are admirably adapted,
opening with a prodigious expansion, and assisted by numerous long bristles,
which prevent the escape of an insect once within their enclosure. In a
single instance the remains of a small bird are said to have been found within
the stomach of one of this species.</p>

<p>The inner side of each middle claw of the <i class="birdname">Chuck-will’s Widow</i> is deeply
pectinated. The apparent use of this appendage, as in the other species in
which it is found, appears to be as an aid in adjusting the plumage, and
perhaps to assist in removing vermin.</p>

<p>The eggs of this bird are never more than two in number. They are
oval in shape, large for the size of the bird, and alike at either end. Their
ground-color is a clear crystal white. They are more or less spotted, and
marked over their entire surface with blotches of varying size, of a dark
purplish-brown, and cloudings of a grayish-lavender color, with smaller occasional
markings of a light raw-umber brown. In shape and markings
they very closely resemble those of the Whippoorwill, differing chiefly in
their much larger size. They measure 1.44 inches in length by 1.06 in
breadth.</p>

Bristles without lateral filaments. Wing about 6.50 inches long. Top of
the head ashy-brown, longitudinally streaked with black. Terminal half of the tail-feathers
(except the four central) dirty white on both outer and inner webs. Length,

Guatemala). Coban (<abbr title="Salvin"><span class="sc">Salv.</span></abbr> Ibis, <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>, 275).</p>

<p>In this species the bristles at the base of the bill, though stiff and long,
are without the lateral filaments of the Chuck-will’s Widow. The wings are
rather short; the second quill longest; the first intermediate between the
third and fourth. The tail is rounded; the outer feathers about half an
inch shorter than the middle ones.</p>

<p>The colors of this species are very difficult to describe, although there is
quite a similarity to those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. carolinensis</i>, from which its greatly inferior
size will at once distinguish it. The top of the head is an ashy gray, finely
mottled, with a broad median stripe of black; all the feathers with a narrow
stripe of the same along their centres. The back and rump are somewhat
<!--462.png--><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 414]</span>
similar, though of a different shade. There is a collar of white on the
under side of the neck, posterior to which the upper part of the breast is
finely mottled, somewhat as on the top of the head. The belly is dirty
white, with indistinct transverse bands and mottlings of brown. The wings
are brown; each quill with a series of round rufous spots on both webs,
quite conspicuous on the outer side of the primaries when the wings are
folded. The terminal half of the outer three tail-feathers is of a dirty white.</p>

<p>The female is smaller; the collar on the throat is tinged with fulvous.
The conspicuous white patch of the tail is wanting, the tips only of the
outer three feathers being of a pale brownish-fulvous.</p>

<p>Mexican and Guatemalan specimens are identical with those from the
United States.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The well-known Whippoorwill has an extended range throughout
the eastern portion of North America, from the Atlantic to the valley
of the Missouri, and from Southern Florida to about the 50th parallel of
north latitude. Dr. Richardson observed this bird on the northern shores
of Lake Huron, but did not meet with it at any point farther north. It is
found throughout New England and in portions of New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia, but is rare in the latter places, and is not common in the vicinity
of Calais. It breeds from Florida northward. It has not been found as
far west as Texas. It was noticed by Mr. Say at Pembina. It is given by
Dr. Hall, of Montreal, as common in that neighborhood, and by Mr. McIlwraith
as an abundant summer resident around Hamilton, Canada. Dr.
Lembeye names it as a resident Cuban species, and Dr. Gundlach informed
me that he had taken its eggs within that island. I have also received its
eggs from various portions of Florida.</p>

<p>The Whippoorwill is nowhere a resident species in any portion of the
United States. They make their appearance in the Southern States early
in March, and very gradually proceed northward, entering Pennsylvania
early in April, but not being seen in New York or New England until the
last of that month, and sometimes not until the 10th of May. Mr. Maynard
mentions their first appearance in Massachusetts as from the 19th to the
24th of May, but I have repeatedly known them in full cry near Boston at
least a fortnight earlier than this, and in the western part of the State Mr.
Allen has noted their arrival by the 25th of April. They leave in the latter
part of September. Mr. Allen also observed the abundant presence of
these birds in Western Iowa, where he heard their notes as late as the 20th
of September.</p>

<p>In its habits the Whippoorwill is very nearly the counterpart of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carolinensis</i>. Like that bird, it is exclusively nocturnal, keeping, during the
day, closely within the recesses of dark woods, and remaining perfectly
silent, uttering no note even when disturbed in these retreats. In very
cloudy weather, late in the day, these birds may be seen hunting for insects,
but this is not usual, and they utter no sound until it is quite dark.</p>

<p><!--463.png--><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 415]</span>
Like the preceding species, this bird receives its common name of Whippoorwill
from its nocturnal cry, which has some slight resemblance to these
three sounds; but the cry is so rapidly enunciated and so incessantly repeated
that a fertile imagination may give various interpretations to the
sounds. They are never uttered when the bird is in motion, but usually at
short intervals, when resting on a fence, or bush, or any other object near the
ground.</p>

<p>Their flight is noiseless to an incredible degree, and they rarely fly far at
a time. They are usually very shy, and are easily startled if approached.
At night, as soon as the twilight disappears, these birds issue from their retreats,
and fly out into more open spaces in quest of their favorite food.
As many of the nocturnal insects, moths, beetles, and others, are attracted
about dwellings by lights, the Whippoorwill is frequently enticed, in pursuit,
into the same vicinity. For several successive seasons these birds have
appeared nearly every summer evening within my grounds, often within a
few feet of the house. They never suffer a very near approach, but fly as
soon as they notice any movement. Their pursuit of insects is somewhat
different from that narrated of the preceding species, their flights being
usually quite brief, without any perceptible sailing, and more in the manner
of Flycatchers. Their song is given out at intervals throughout the night,
until near the dawn.</p>

<p>The nocturnal habits of this bird have prevented a general or accurate
knowledge of its true character. Strange as it may seem, in many parts
of the country the Night-Hawk and the Whippoorwill are supposed to be
one and the same bird, even by those not ill informed in other respects.
This was found to be the case in Pennsylvania by Wilson, and is equally
true of many portions of New England, though disputed by Mr. Audubon.</p>

<p>Like the Chuck-will’s Widow, this species removes its eggs, and also its
young, to a distant and safer locality, if they are visited and handled. Wilson
once, in passing through a piece of wood, came accidentally upon a
young bird of this species. The parent attempted to draw him away by
well-feigned stratagems. Wilson stopped and sketched the bird, and, returning
again, after a short absence, to the same place, in search of a pencil he
had left behind, found that the bird had been spirited away by its vigilant
parent.</p>

<p>When disturbed by an intrusive approach, the Whippoorwill resorts to
various expedients to divert attention to herself from her offspring. She
flutters about as if wounded and unable to fly, beats the ground with her
wings as if not able to rise from it, and enacts these feints in a manner to
deceive even the most wary, risking her own life to save her offspring.</p>

<p>The Whippoorwills construct no nest, but deposit their eggs in the thickest
and most shady portions of the woods, among fallen leaves, in hollows
slightly excavated for that purpose, or upon the leaves themselves. For
this purpose elevated and dry places are always selected, often near some
<!--464.png--><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 416]</span>
fallen log. There they deposit two eggs, elliptical in shape. Their young,
when first hatched, are perfectly helpless, and their safety largely depends
upon their great similarity to small pieces of mouldy earth. They grow
rapidly, and are soon able to follow their mother and to partially care for
themselves.</p>

<p>The egg of the Whippoorwill has a strong family resemblance to those
of both species of European <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caprimulgi</i>, and is a complete miniature of that
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. carolinensis</i>. In shape it is oblong and oval, equally obtuse at either
end. Resembling the egg of the Chuck-will’s Widow, it is yet more noticeable
for the purity of its colors and the beauty of their contrast. The ground-color
is a clear and pure shade of cream-white. The whole egg is irregularly
spotted and marbled with lines and patches of purplish-lavender,
mingled with reddish-brown. The former are fainter, and as if partially
obscured, the brown usually much more distinct. The eggs measure 1.25
inches in length by .88 of an inch in breadth. Wilson’s account of its egg
is wholly inaccurate.</p>

<p>In the extreme Southern States these eggs are deposited in April, in
Virginia and Pennsylvania about the middle of May, and farther north not
until early in June. The young are hatched and able to care for themselves
during July, but, with the female, rarely leave the woods. The notes of the
male are once more occasionally heard in August. Mr. Allen has heard
them late in September, but I have never happened to notice their cries
later than August.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall states that the young of these birds, at an early age, run about
with remarkable celerity, and that they utter, at short intervals a <i class="birdcall">pé-ūgh</i>,
in a low mournful tone. Their food appears to consist of various kinds of
nocturnal insects, besides ants, grasshoppers, and other kinds not nocturnal,
frequenting decaying wood and shady thickets.</p>

<p>Nuttall’s Whippoorwill is readily distinguished from the other North American
species by the transverse, not longitudinal, lines on the top of head, the
narrow white tip of tail on both webs, and the inferior size, as well as by
numerous other points of difference.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species was first described by Mr. Audubon from a specimen
obtained near the Rocky Mountains, but with no information in regard
to any peculiarities of habit. From Mr. Nuttall we learn that these birds
were first observed by him on the 10th of June, amidst the naked granite
hills of the sources of the Upper Platte River, called Sweet-Water. It was
about twilight, and from the clefts of the rocks they were uttering at intervals
a low wailing cry, in the manner of the Whippoorwill, and sounding
like the cry of the young of that species, or <i class="birdcall">pē-cū</i>. Afterwards, on the 7th
of August, when encamped on the high ravine of the insulated mountains
so conspicuous from Lewis River, called the Three Buttes, this bird was
again observed, as it flew from under a stone near the summit of the mountain.
It flew about hawking for insects near their elevated camp, for two
or three hours, but was now silent. On the 16th of June, near the banks
of the Sandy River of the Colorado, Mr. Nuttall again heard its nocturnal
cry, which he says sounded like <i class="birdcall">pēvai</i>.</p>

<p><!--466.png--><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 418]</span>
Dr. Cooper did not meet with this bird in the Colorado Valley, but he
heard their nocturnal call, which he says sounds like <i class="birdcall">poor-will</i>, on the barren
mountains west of the valley, in May. He has never seen or heard any
west of the Coast Range, nor in the Santa Clara Valley in the spring. They
are, however, said to be common in the hot interior valleys, and remain near
San Francisco as late as November, usually hiding on the ground, and flying
at dusk in short, fitful courses in pursuit of insects. Dr. Cooper adds
that they inhabit the almost bare and barren sage-plains east of the Sierra
Nevada, where their rather sad whistle is heard all night during the spring,
sounding like an echoing answer to the cry of the eastern species.</p>

<p>Dr. Suckley, in the Report on the Zoölogy of Washington Territory, speaks
of this species as moderately abundant in the interior of that Territory, as
well as of Oregon. East of the Cascade Mountains, at Fort Dalles, they can
be heard on almost any fine night in spring or early summer. Their cries
closely resemble those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vociferus</i>, but are more feeble, and not so incessantly
kept up. Dr. Cooper, in the same report, also speaks of finding this
bird common near the Yakima River, in 1853. Two specimens were killed
in the daytime by a whip. Late in the evening he found them flying near
the ground. Dr. Woodhouse, in passing down the Little Colorado River, in
New Mexico, found this bird quite abundant, as also among the San Francisco
Mountains.</p>

<p>Dr. Newberry met with this species in all the parts of California and
Oregon visited by him. Near the shores of Rhett Lake he met with its
nest containing two young nearly ready to fly. The old bird fluttered off as
if disabled, and by her cries and strange movements induced one of the party
to pursue her. The young resembled those of the eastern species, were of a
gray-brown color, marbled with black, and had large, dark, and soft eyes.
They were quite passive when caught.</p>

<p>This species was observed by Mr. J. H. Clark near Rio Mimbres, in New
Mexico. From the manner in which it flew, it seemed so similar to the
Woodcock that until a specimen was obtained it was supposed to belong to
that family. He saw none east of the Rio Grande, but met with it as far west
as Santa Cruz. It was nowhere abundant, and was generally solitary. It
was found usually among the tall grass of the valleys, and occasionally on the
plains. It was only once observed to alight upon a bush, but almost invariably,
when started up, it flew down again among the grass at a short distance.</p>

<p>A single specimen of this bird was taken by Dr. Kennerly on the Great
Colorado River. Dr. Heermann met with two specimens among the mountains
bordering the Tejon Valley, and he was informed by Dr. Milhau that a
small species of Whippoorwill was abundant round that fort in the spring
and summer.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann killed one of these birds on the Medina, in Texas; and
during the summer, passing along Devil’s River, he heard their notes every
evening, and judged that the birds were abundant. Mr. Dresser obtained a
<!--467.png--><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 419]</span>
single specimen, shot near the town of San Antonio, where it was of uncommon
occurrence. He received also another specimen from Fort Stockton.
During his stay at Matamoras he did not notice this bird, but was
informed that a kind resembling this species was very common at a rancho
about twenty-five miles distant, on the Monterey road. Dr. Coues found
this species particularly abundant throughout Arizona. At Fort Whipple it
was a summer resident, arriving there late in April and remaining until
October. So numerous was it in some localities, that around the campfires
of the traveller a perfect chorus of their plaintive two-syllabled notes
was continued incessantly through the night, some of the performers being
so near that the sharp click of their mandibles was distinctly audible.</p>

<p>Mr. J. A. Allen found this species abundant on the lower parts of the
mountains in Colorado, and heard the notes of scores of them near the
mouth of Ogden Cañon on several occasions after nightfall. Though so
numerous, all efforts to procure specimens were futile, as it did not usually
manifest its presence till after it became too dark for it to be clearly distinguished.
He saw it last, October 7, during a severe snow-storm on the
mountains north of Ogden. It had been quite common during the greater
part of September. He also met with this bird at an elevation of 7,000
feet. He had previously ascertained its presence throughout Kansas from
Leavenworth to Fort Hays.</p>

<p>From these varied observations the range of this species may be given as
from the valley of the Rio Grande and the more northern States of Mexico,
throughout New Mexico, Arizona, and the Great Plains nearly to the Pacific,
in California, Oregon, and Washington Territory.</p>

<p>The egg of this species (13,587) was obtained among the East Humboldt
Mountains, by Mr. Robert Ridgway, July 20, 1868. Its measurement is
1.06 inches in length by .81 of an inch in breadth. It is of a regularly
elliptical form, being equally rounded at either end. Its color is a clear
dead-white, entirely unspotted. The egg was found deposited on the bare
ground beneath a sage-bush, on a foot-slope of the mountains. The nest
was nothing more than a bare spot, apparently worn by the body of the bird.
When found, the male bird was sitting on the egg, and was shot as it flew
from the spot.</p>

<p>Mr. Salvin (Ibis, <abbr title="Three">III</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 64) mentions taking, April 20, 1860, on the mountains
of Santa Barbara, Central America, a species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antrostomus</i>, a female,
with two eggs. This is spoken of as nearly allied to, perhaps identical with,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. vociferus</i>. Its eggs are, however, spoken of as white, measuring 1.05
inches by .80 of an inch, almost exactly the size of the eggs of this species.
Mr. Salvin adds: “I do not quite understand these eggs being white, except
by supposing them to be accidentally so. In other respects, i. e. in form
and texture, they agree with the eggs of other species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caprimulgidæ</i>.
These eggs, two in number, were on the ground at the foot of a large pine-tree.
There was no nest.”</p>

<p><!--468.png--><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 420]</span>
In regard to the parentage of the eggs thus discovered, the coloration and
size of which correspond so closely with those of the Poor-will, Mr. Salvin
writes, in a letter dated March 10, 1872: “In respect to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antrostomus</i>
which lays white eggs in Guatemala, I have carefully examined the skin of
the female sent to me with the eggs in question, and represented as their
parent. It certainly is not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. nuttalli</i>, but appears to belong to the species
described by Wagler as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. macromystax</i>. This species is very closely
allied to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. vociferus</i>, but appears to be sufficiently distinct, inasmuch as
the rictal bristles are very long, the throat is almost without white feathers,
and the white on the tail is more limited in extent than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. vociferus</i>.
The true <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. vociferus</i> is frequently found in winter in Guatemala, but is
probably only a migrant. The other species would certainly appear to be a
resident in South Mexico and Guatemala. With respect to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. nuttalli</i>, I
may add that I have recently acquired a skin from Guanajuata, in Mexico.
This is the first instance of the occurrence of the species in Mexico at all,
that I am aware of.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway met with the Poor-will from the eastern slope of the Sierra
Nevada to the Wahsatch and Uintah Mountains. He describes its notes as
much like those of the eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. vociferus</i>, except that the first syllable is
left off, the call sounding like simply <i class="birdcall">poor-will</i>, the accent on the last syllable.
It frequents chiefly the dry <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mesa</i> and foot-hills of the mountains, and
lives almost entirely on the ground, where its two white unspotted eggs are
deposited beneath some small scraggy sage-bush, without any sign of a nest
whatever. Both sexes incubate.</p>

<h2>
<span class="sc">Family</span> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">CYPSELIDÆ</span>.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Swifts.</span></h2>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Characteristics"><span class="sc">Char.</span></abbr>
Bill very small, without notch, triangular, much broader than high; the culmen
not one sixth the gape. Anterior toes cleft to the base, each with three joints, (in the
typical species,) and covered with skin or feathers; the middle claw without any serrations;
the lateral toes nearly equal to the middle. Bill without bristles, but with minute feathers
extending along the under margin of the nostrils. Tail-feathers ten. Nostrils elongated,
superior, and very close together. Plumage compact. Primaries ten, elongated, falcate.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cypselidæ</i>, or Swifts, are Swallow-like birds, generally of rather dull
plumage and medium size. They were formerly associated with the true
Swallows on account of their small, deeply cleft bill, wide gape, short feet,
and long wings, but are very different in all the essentials of structure,
belonging, indeed, to a different order or suborder. The bill is much smaller
and shorter; the edges greatly inflected; the nostrils superior, instead of
lateral, and without bristles. The wing is more falcate, with ten primaries
instead of nine. The tail has ten feathers instead of twelve. The feet are
weaker, without distinct scutellæ; the hind toe is more or less versatile, the
anterior toes frequently lack the normal number of joints, and there are
other features which clearly justify the wide separation here given, especially
the difference in the vocal organs. Strange as the statement may be, their
nearest relatives are the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trochilidæ</i>, or Humming-Birds, notwithstanding
the bills of the two are as opposite in shape as can readily be conceived.
The sternum of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cypselidæ</i> is also very different from that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hirundinidæ</i>,
as will be shown by the accompanying figure. There are no emarginations
or openings in the posterior edge, which is regularly curved. The
keel rises high, for the attachment of the powerful pectoral muscles. The
manubrium is almost entirely wanting.</p>

<p>In this family, as in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caprimulgidæ</i>, we find deviations in certain
forms from the normal number of phalanges to the toes, which serve to
divide it into two sections. In one, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chæturinæ</i>, these are 2, 3, 4, and 5, as

<p>The Swifts are cosmopolite, occurring throughout the globe. All the
genera enumerated above are well represented in the New World, except
the last two, which are exclusively East Indian and Polynesian. Species of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Collocallia</i> make the “edible bird’s-nests” which are so much sought after in
China and Japan. These are constructed entirely out of the hardened saliva
of the bird, although formerly supposed to be made of some kind of sea-weed.
All the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cypselidæ</i> have the salivary glands highly developed, and use the secretion
to cement together the twigs or other substances of which the nest is constructed,
as well as to attach this to its support. The eggs are always white.</p>

<p>There are many interesting peculiarities connected with the modification
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cypselidæ</i>, some of which may be briefly adverted to. Those of our
common Chimney Swallow will be referred to in the proper place. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Panyptila
sancti-hieronymæ</i> of Guatemala attaches a tube some feet in length to
the under side of an overhanging rock, constructed of the pappus or seed-down
of plants, caught flying in the air. Entrance to this is from below,
and the eggs are laid on a kind of shelf near the top. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chætura poliura</i> of
Brazil again makes a very similar tube-nest (more contracted below) out of
the seeds of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trixis divaricata</i>, suspends it to a horizontal branch, and covers
<!--471.png--><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 423]</span>
the outside with feathers of various colors. As there is no shelf to receive
the eggs, it is believed that these are cemented against the sides of the
tube, and brooded on by the bird while in an upright position. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendrochelidon
klecho</i>, of Java, etc., builds a narrow flat platform on a horizontal
branch, of feathers, moss, etc., cemented together, and lays in it a single
egg. The nest is so small that the bird sits on the branch and covers the
egg with the end of her belly.</p>

<p>Owing to the almost incredible rapidity in flight of the Swifts, and the great
height in the air at which they usually keep themselves, the North American
species are, of all our land birds, the most difficult to procure, only flying
sufficiently near the surface of the ground to be reached by a gun in damp
weather, and then requiring great skill to shoot them. Their nests, too,
are generally situated in inaccessible places, usually high perpendicular
or overhanging mountain-cliffs. Although our four species are sufficiently
abundant, and are frequently seen in flocks of thousands, it is only the common
Chimney Swift that is to be met with at all regularly in museums.</p>

<p>The essential character of this subfamily, as stated already, is to be found
in the feathered tarsus; the reduction of the normal number of phalanges in
the middle toe from 4 to 3, and of the outer toe from 5 to 3, as well as
in the anterior or lateral position of the hind toe, not posterior. Of the
two genera assigned to it by Dr. Sclater, one, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cypselus</i>, is enlarged by him so

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This new species was first discovered by Dr. Kennerly on Bill
Williams Fork, New Mexico, February 16, 1854. He speaks of it as a
very curious and interesting bird, found by him only among the cañons of
that stream, and not observed
elsewhere during their journey.
Large flocks could be seen at any
time in the vicinity of those
cañons, flying and circling around
very high, and far beyond the
reach of shot. Towards the close
of the day, when the sun had sunk
behind the hills, they occasionally
descended lower. He only met
with them where the walls of the
cañons were very high, and consisted
of almost perpendicular
masses of rock. At times they
were seen to sweep low down, and then to ascend nearly perpendicularly
very near the stones, as if examining them in order to select a place for
their nests. The construction of these had obviously not then commenced.
Dr. Kennerly saw none engaged in the work, nor did he observe any old
nests, unless they build after the manner of the common Cliff Swallow,
which were also abundant in that region. Mr. Möllhausen was of the
opinion that these birds build in the holes and crevices of the cliffs. In
their flight and habits they appeared to closely resemble the common
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chætura pelagica</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann met with this species several times, first in San Fernando
Pass, near Los Angelos, and again near Palm Spring, between the Colorado
desert and Vallicita, at another time near Tucson, and once also in Texas.
He always found them flying at a great height, either far beyond or on the
extreme limit of gunshot range. From the extent of their wings they
seemed formed to live in the air, where they pass most of their time gliding
about in extensive circles, with apparently very little motion of the wings.
During pleasant weather they found their insect prey in the upper air, but,
when cloudy or rainy, they flew nearer the ground in their pursuit. When
on the ground, they were observed to rise with difficulty, owing to the
shortness of their legs and the length of their wings. When they rest,
they always alight on some elevated point whence they can throw themselves
into the air, and take to wing. Numbers were observed flying
about the rocks near Tucson, but none were heard to utter a note. They
were sociable among themselves, gathering in large flocks, but never
mingled with the Swallows. He states that they construct their nests in
<!--474.png--><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 426]</span>
the crevices of rocks, and that their eggs are pure white, and of an elongated
form.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found this species rather sparingly distributed throughout Arizona,
always in the neighborhood of cliffs and precipices, which it exclusively
inhabits. From Inscription Rock, about one day’s march from
Whipple’s Pass, to the San Francisco Mountains of Arizona, he found these
birds in great numbers, except along the valley of the Colorado Chiquito,
where there were no suitable cliffs for their habitation. He generally found
them congregated in considerable, sometimes in immense, numbers in the
vicinity of huge cliffs and piles of rocks. Their note, he adds, is an often and
quickly repeated twitter, loud and shrill, and quite different from that of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. pelagica</i>. He states that they build their nest upon the vertical faces
of precipitous rocks.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse met with a Swift in the same region referred to by Dr.
Coues, which he called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acanthylis saxatilis</i>, which may possibly be the same
species, but of which no specimen was procured. They were breeding in
the crevices of the rocks. The description, however, does not at all correspond.</p>

<p>This species has lately been met with by Mr. Salvin, in Guatemala, where
it is by no means common, and so very local that its presence might readily
have been overlooked. He found it near Dueñas, in a gorge with precipitous
rocks on the right hand, along the course of the river Guacalate. His
attention was drawn to a noise coming from the rocks, which he at first took
to be bats in some of the cracks. After watching for some time, he saw two
Swifts dart into a crack in the rock twenty feet from the ground, and the
noise became louder than before. Resorting to several expedients, in vain,
to make them fly out, he climbed up part way, and there found one of them
killed by a random shot of his gun. Another discharge of his gun brought
out five or six more, which were immediately pursued by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cotyle serripennis</i>.
He obtained three specimens in all. The spot was evidently their
common roosting-place, and by the noise they made he judged they were
there in large numbers. He found them about the middle of February.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper met with this species near Fort Mohave, but saw none before
May. On the 7th of June, near the head of Mohave River, he found a few
about some lofty granite cliffs, and succeeded in obtaining one. Their flight
was exceedingly swift and changeable, and they were very difficult to shoot.
He also found them about some high rocky bluffs close to the sea-shore,
twelve miles north of San Diego. They were seen the last of March, but
may have been there for a month previously.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen encountered this little-known Swift near Colorado City, where
it was quite numerous about the high cliffs in the “Garden of the Gods,”
and of which, with great difficulty, he procured four specimens. It was
nesting in inaccessible crevices and weather-beaten holes in the rocks, about
midway up the high vertical cliffs, some of which were not less than three
<!--475.png--><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 427]</span>
hundred feet high. It seemed to be very wary, and flew with great velocity,
rarely descending within reach of the guns.</p>

<p>The White-throated Swift was met with in great abundance by Mr. Ridgway
at the East Humboldt Mountains, and was seen by him more sparingly
in the Toyabe and Wahsatch. In the former mountains it inhabited the high
limestone cliffs which walled the cañons, congregating in thousands, and
nesting in the chinks or crevices of the rocks, in company with the Violet-green
Swallow (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tachycincta thalassina</i>). It was a very noisy species, having
a vigorous chatter, reminding one somewhat of the notes of young Baltimore
Orioles when being fed by their parents. It was also very pugnacious, a
couple now and then being seen to fasten upon one another high up in the
air, and, clinging together, falling, whirling round and round in their descent,
nearly to the ground, when they would let go each other, and separate.
A couple would often rush by with almost inconceivable velocity, one in
chase of the other. Their flight was usually very high, or, if they occasionally
descended, it was so swiftly that Mr. Ridgway only succeeded in shooting
three specimens, while he found it utterly impossible to reach their nests,
which were in the horizontal fissures in the face of the overhanging cliff.</p>

<p>This subfamily is characterized by having the normal number of phalanges

position of the hind toe, and the naked tarsi, which do not even appear to
be scutellate, but covered with a soft skin. Of the two North American

<p>The comparative characters of this genus will be found in the diagnostic

family. According to
Sclater, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cypseloides</i> of
Streubel (<span class="sc">Isis</span>, 1848,

it was named by Streubel
as an alternative
to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hemiprocne</i>, which
belongs to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chætura</i>.
Until this question
of synonymy can be
decided positively, we retain <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nephœcetes</i>.</p>

<p>The single North American species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">N. niger</i>, has a singular distribution,

Wing the length of the body. General color rather lustrous dark sooty-brown,
with a greenish gloss, becoming a very little lighter on the breast anteriorly
below, but rather more so on the neck and head above. The feathers on top of the head
edged with light gray, which forms a continuous wash on each side of the forehead
above, and anterior to the usual black crescent in front of the eye. Occasionally some
feathers of the under parts behind are narrowly edged with gray. Bill and feet black.
Length, 6.75; wing, 6.75; tail, 3.00, the depth of its fork about .45 in the male, and
scarcely .15 in the female.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>

<p>The tail is considerably more forked in the male than in the female, in
which it is sometimes nearly even, and in the males its depth varies considerably.</p>

<p>Jamaican specimens (<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">niger</i>) are rather smaller, considerably blacker,
and seem to have narrower tail-feathers, even when the other dimensions are
about equal.</p>

<p>Whether the Puget Sound bird visits the West Indies is not known; but
the difference in size and colors between them and the West Indian birds
would seem to indicate that they select a more directly southern region.
The fact that the Orizaba specimen is most like the Northwest Coast birds
favors this latter supposition.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This Swift is of irregular and local occurrence in the West
Indies and in Western North America. Specimens were obtained at Simiahmoo
Bay, Washington Territory, by Dr. Kennerly, in July, 1857. Dr.
Cooper saw a black Swift, which he thinks may have been this species, in
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Pah-Ute Cañon</span>, west of Fort Mohave, May 29, 1861, and again at Santa
Barbara, May, 1863.</p>

<p>Dr. Gundlach, in his ornithological explorations in Cuba, in 1858, met
with this species among the mountains between Cienfuegos and Trinidad, on
the southern coast of that island, and also in the eastern parts of the Sierra
Maestra. He saw these birds for the first time in the month of May, near
Bayamo, where they commonly arrived every morning about one hour after
sunrise, and flew in a circular direction over the river at a considerable
height, making their evolutions always in the same place, apparently employed
in catching the insects attracted by the proximity of the river.
<!--478.png--><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 430]</span>
In the month of June they came every day towards noon, whenever it
threatened to rain, and sometimes returned again after sunset. When tired
of their exercise they always flew together towards the mountains, where he
had no doubt their breeding-places existed. He states that when one of
these birds flies in chase of another, it emits a soft continued note, not
unlike a song. Having taken many young birds in the month of June, he
supposes that these Swifts breed in April and May.</p>

<p>It is stated by Sumichrast to have been occasionally met with in the table-lands
of Mexico, and that it is resident and breeds within the State of Vera
Cruz, Mexico.</p>

<p>A single specimen of this bird was known to Gosse to have been taken
near Spanishtown in Jamaica, in 1843, in company with many others. Mr.
March, in his paper on the birds of this island, gives a similar account of
the habits of this species to that of Dr. Gundlach. He states that it was
rarely seen except at early dawn, or in dull and cloudy weather, or after
rain in an afternoon. He has sometimes procured specimens from Healthshire
and the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Catharine Hills. The only place known to him as their
actual resort is a cave in the lower <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Catharine Hills, near the ferry,
where they harbor in the narrow deep galleries and fissures of the limestone
rocks.</p>

<p>Mr. J. K. Lord cites this species as among the earliest of the spring visitors
seen by him in British Columbia. On a foggy morning early in June,
the insects being low, these birds were hovering close to the ground, and he
obtained four specimens. He saw no more until the fall of the year, when
they again made their appearance in large numbers, among the many other
birds of that season. He again saw this Swift at Fort Colville.</p>

<p>Captain Prevost, <abbr title="Royal Navy">R. N.</abbr>, obtained a single specimen of this bird on Vancouver
Island, which Mr. Sclater compared with Gosse’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cypselus niger</i>,
from Jamaica. He, however, is not satisfied as to their identity, and is
inclined to regard the two birds as distinct.</p>

<p>According to Captain Feilner, this species breeds in the middle of June,
on high rocks on the Klamath River, about eight miles above Judah’s
Cave.</p>

<p>The Black Swift was seen by Mr. Ridgway, during his western tour, only
once, when, about the middle of June, an assembly of several hundreds
was observed early one morning hovering over the Carson River, below
Fort Churchill, in Nevada. In the immediate vicinity was an immense
rocky cliff, where he supposed they nested. In their flight they much resembled
Chimney-Swallows (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chætura</i>), only they appeared much larger.
They were perfectly silent. On the Truckee River, near Pyramid Lake,
in May of the same year, he found the remains of one which had been
killed by a hawk, but the species was not seen there alive.</p>

<p>The etymology of the specific
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pelasgia</i>, used by Linnæus,
of this bird, in the twelfth
edition of Systema Naturæ,
has always been a question.
We find that the word in the
tenth edition is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pelagica</i>, referring
probably to the supposed
passage over the Caribbean Sea in its annual migrations.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chætura vauxi</i>, the western representative of this bird, is extremely similar,
but distinguishable by considerably smaller size, much lighter, almost white,
throat, paler rump, and under parts decidedly lighter than the back. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C.
poliura</i>, which much resembles it, is blacker above, and much darker below.

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The common Chimney Swallow of North America has an extended
range throughout the eastern portions of the continent, from the
Atlantic to the 50th parallel of northern latitude. It was not met with by
Dr. Richardson in the fur regions, but was found by Say at Pembina, on
<!--481.png--><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 433]</span>
the Red River, in what is now the northern part of Minnesota. Its western
range is not well determined, but is presumed to be terminated by the great
plains. It has been found as far west as Bijoux Hill, in Nebraska.</p>

<p>In its habits, especially during the breeding-season, this Swift presents
many remarkable differences from the European species. While the latter
are shy and retiring, shunning the places frequented by man, and breeding
chiefly in caves or ruined and deserted habitations, their representatives in
eastern North America, like all the Swallow family here, have, immediately
upon the erection of the dwellings of civilized life, manifested their appreciation
of the protection they afford, by an entire change in their habits in
regard to the location of their nests. When the country was first settled,
these birds were known to breed only in the hollow trunks of forest trees.
The chimneys of the dwellings of civilized communities presented sufficient
inducements, in their greater convenience, to tempt this bird to forsake their
primitive breeding-places. The change in this respect has been nearly complete.
And now, in the older portions of the country, they are not known
to resort to hollow trees for any other purpose than as an occasional roosting-place.</p>

<p>In wild portions of the country, where natural facilities are still afforded
to these Swifts, they are occasionally found breeding within the hollows
of decaying trees. Mr. George A. Boardman, of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen, <abbr title="New Brunswick">N. B.</abbr>, writes
that in his neighborhood this bird continues to build in the hollows of
trees. He adds, that in the summer of 1863 he found them building within
a hollow birch. He also met with one of their nests built against a board
in an old winter logging-camp, at a distance from any chimney. Mr.
Ridgway has also met with the nest of this bird inside the trunk of a large
sycamore-tree, and also mentions finding another attached to the planks of
an outbuilding, in the Wabash valley of Southeastern Illinois.</p>

<p>Mr. J. A. Allen found this species quite numerous in Kansas, where it
was breeding chiefly in the hollow trees of the forests, which it always
seems naturally to prefer to chimneys, to which it is compelled to resort, in
most of the longer settled districts, or else wholly to abandon the country.</p>

<p>The Chimney Swallow is known to breed throughout the Central and
Northern States, from Virginia to Canada. Dr. Woodhouse states that he
found this species very abundant throughout the Indian Territory, as also in
Texas, and New Mexico, even to California. It was not, however, taken at
San Antonio by Mr. Dresser, nor in any portion of Texas, and was not procured
by any of the naturalists in the other Western expeditions.</p>

<p>The Chimney Swallow is crepuscular, rather than nocturnal, in its habits,
preferring to hunt for its insect prey in dull and cloudy weather, or in the
early morning and the latter part of the afternoon. In this it is probably
influenced by the abundance or scarcity of insects, as it is not unfrequently
to be seen hawking for insects in the bright glare of noon. When
they have young, they often continue to feed them until quite late at night.
<!--482.png--><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 434]</span>
They are not, however, to be regarded as nocturnal, as they are only known
to do this during a brief period.</p>

<p>The nest of this species is a very peculiar and remarkable structure. It
is composed of small twigs of nearly uniform size, wrought and interwoven
into a neat semicircular basket. In selecting the twigs with which they are
to construct their nests, the Swifts break from the tree the ends of living
branches, which they gather with great skill and adroitness while on the
wing. Sweeping upon the coveted twig somewhat as a Hawk rushes on its
prey, it divides it at the desired place, and bears it off to its nest. This is
a well-attested fact, familiar to all who have ever watched these birds in
the early morning as they are at work constructing their nests.</p>

<p>Each one of these twigs is strongly fastened to its fellows by an adhesive
saliva secreted by the bird, and by the same cement the whole structure is
made to adhere to the side of the chimney in which it is built. This saliva,
as it dries, hardens into a tough glue-like substance, as firm even as the
twigs it unites. In separating nests from the sides of chimneys, I have
known portions of the brick to which it was fastened part sooner than the
cement. When moistened, however, by long-continued rains, the weight of
their contents will sometimes cause these nests to part, and the whole is
precipitated to the bottom. The young birds cling very tenaciously to the
sides of the chimneys with their bills and claws. They not only are often
able, in these accidents, to save themselves from falling, but even at a
very early age can cling to the sides of the chimney and work their way
to the top. They always leave their nest and climb to the upper part of
the chimney several days before they can fly, and are there fed by their
parents.</p>

<p>Occasionally the young birds fall to the bottom of the chimney, out of the
reach or notice of their parents. I have never been able to induce them to
take any food, although they keep uttering pitiful cries of hunger. In such
cases the young birds placed on the roof near their native chimney soon
manage to climb to its base, and there receive the aid of the old birds.</p>

<p>Their eggs are four in number, somewhat elliptical in form, though somewhat
less obtuse at one end than the other. They are of a pure white
color, and are never spotted. They vary but little in size or shape, and
measure from .75 to .81 of an inch in length, and from .50 to .55 in breadth.</p>

<p>In New England the Chimney Swallow raises but one brood in a season.
In Pennsylvania it is said to have two.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Pacific coast, from Puget’s Sound to California. West coast to Guatemala (<abbr title="Sclater"><span class="sc">Scl.</span></abbr>
<abbr title="Proceedings Zoölogical Society">P. Z. S.</abbr> 1863, 100); Yucatan (<abbr title="Lawrence Annals New York Lyceum Nine"><span class="sc">Lawr.</span> Ann. N. Y. Lyc. IX</abbr>, 204).</p>

<p>This species bears a very close resemblance to the common Chimney Swallow
of the Eastern States, being only readily distinguishable by its much
smaller size, 4.50 inches instead of 5.25. The wing, too, is nearly an inch
shorter. The tarsus and the middle toe, however, seem absolutely longer.
The rump is a little paler than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. pelagica</i>, as well as the under parts,
where the chin and throat are lighter, almost dirty white, and gradually
becoming a little darker behind, although even the hinder part of the belly
is much lighter than the back, even in strong contrast, instead of being of
the same color with it. Guatemalan specimens are much darker.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This western Swift was first discovered by Mr. Townsend on the
Columbia River, where he found it having the primitive habits of the eastern
species, and breeding in hollow trees, forming a nest in a similar manner, and
laying four pure-white eggs. It differs from the common bird in its smaller
size and lighter color. It is said to occur from Puget Sound to California.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper met with these birds May 4, 1864, in the Coast Range, twelve
miles south of Santa Clara. He was of the opinion that they had nests in
hollow trees at the summit of the mountains, but he was not able to find
any. He did not observe any at Fort Vancouver in the summer of 1853,
nor did he learn whether these birds are found in the central valleys of
California. In 1866 they were observed to make their first appearance at
Santa Cruz on the 4th of May, though as they rarely descended to the town
they might have been on the hills earlier than this. On the 5th of October
he observed five of them, in company with a large flock of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hirundo bicolor</i>,
spending the morning in hunting insects near the town. They were apparently
delayed in their migration southward by a thick fog and cold south-wind.
They may have been a late brood from the north.</p>

<p>Dr. Kennerly obtained a single specimen of this species at the Straits of
Fuca, showing that these birds sometimes extend their migrations up to the
49th parallel. Neither Dr. Suckley nor Dr. Cooper was able to find this
Swift anywhere in Washington Territory.</p>

<p><!--484.png--><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 436]</span>
Dr. Newberry observed this species quite common in California, but could
obtain no specimens, owing to the height at which they flew. He saw nothing
of it in Oregon.</p>

<p>Two specimens of this species obtained in Mexico by <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> de Saussure are
in the collection of Dr. Sclater.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway saw on the Truckee River, near Pyramid Lake, in May,
1868, what he supposes to have been this species. It was not common,
only a few individuals being observed every evening just before dusk, flying
overhead exactly in the manner of Chimney Swallows (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. pelagica</i>), which
they also exactly resembled in appearance. They flew so high that specimens
could not be obtained. They were entirely silent, and appeared at no
other time than in the evening, in these respects differing strikingly from
the eastern species.</p>

<h2>
<span class="sc">Family</span> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">TROCHILIDÆ</span>.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Humming-Birds.</span></h2>

<p class="p2 small"><abbr title="Characteristics"><span class="sc">Char.</span></abbr> Least of all birds; sternum very deep; bill subulate, and generally longer than
the head, straight, arched, or upcurved. Tongue composed of two lengthened cylindrical
united tubes, capable of great protrusion, and bifid at tip; nostrils basal, linear, and
covered by an operculum; wings lengthened, pointed; first quill usually longest except
in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aithurus</i>, where it is the second; primaries, 10; secondaries, 6; tail of ten feathers.
Tarsi and feet very diminutive, claws very sharp. (<span class="sc">Gould.</span>)</p>

<p>There is no group of birds so interesting to the ornithologist or to the
casual observer as the Humming-Birds, at once the smallest in size, the most
gorgeously beautiful in color, and almost the most abundant in species, of
any single family of birds. They are strictly confined to the continent and
islands of America, and are most abundant in the Central American and
Andean States, though single species range almost to the Arctic regions on
the north and to Patagonia on the south, as well as from the sea-coast to
the frozen summits of the Andes. Many are very limited in their range;
some confined to particular islands, even though of small dimensions, or to
the summits of certain mountain-peaks.</p>

<p>The bill of the Humming-Bird is awl-shaped or subulate; thin, and sharp-pointed;
straight or curved; sometimes as long as the head, sometimes
much longer. The mandibles are excavated to the tip for the lodgement of
the tongue, and form a tube by the close apposition of their cutting edges.
There is no indication of stiff bristly feathers at the base of the mouth.
The tongue has some resemblance to that of the Woodpecker in the elongation
of the cornua backwards, so as to pass round the back of the skull, and
then anteriorly to the base of the bill. The tongue itself is of very peculiar
structure, consisting anteriorly of two hollow threads closed at the ends and
united behind. The food of the Humming-Bird consists almost entirely of
insects, which are captured by protruding the tongue in flowers of various
shapes without opening the bill very wide.</p>

<p>The genera of Humming-Birds are very difficult to define. This is partly
owing to the great number of the species, of which nearly four hundred and
fifty have been recognized by authors, all of them with but few exceptions
diminutive in size and almost requiring a lens for their critical examination,
so that characters for generic separation, distinct enough in other families, are
here overlooked or not fully appreciated. A still greater difficulty, perhaps, is
the great difference in form, especially of the tail, between the male and female,
the young male occupying an intermediate position. The coloration, too, is
almost always very different with sex and age, and usually any generic
characters derived from features other than those of bill, feet, and wing do
not apply to the females at all.</p>

<p>In the large number of species of Humming-Birds arranged in about one
<!--486.png--><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 438]</span>
hundred and thirty genera, only two subfamilies have been recognized, as
follows:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="indent1"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phæthornithinæ.</b> Anterior toes connected at the base. No metallic lustre
to the dull plumage.</p>

<p class="indent1"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trochilinæ.</b> Anterior toes not connected at the base. Plumage brilliant,
with more or less of metallic lustre, at least in the males.</p>

<p>The first-mentioned subfamily embraces five genera, and about fifty
species, none of which are found in the United States. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trochilinæ</i>
count nearly four hundred species and one hundred and twenty-five genera,
and in the absence of any successful attempt to arrange them in subordinate
groups, the difficulties of determination on the part of the tyro may readily
be imagined.</p>

<p>Of the seven genera accredited to North America, with their ten species,
we cannot pretend to do more than present an artificial analysis, which may
serve to define them as compared with each other, but bear little reference
to the family as a whole. The characters are selected partly from the shape
of tail and partly from color.</p>

<p class="comchar"><span class="sc">Common Characters.</span> All the North American <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trochilidæ</i> have metallic green
backs, excepting <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus rufus</i>, this color extending over the top of head,
except in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calypte</i> (metallic red and violet), and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Heliopædica</i> (bluish-black). The
latter alone has a white stripe through the eye. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atthis heloisæ</i> alone has the tail
tipped with white in the male. Females of all the species except <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Heliopædica</i>
have tail tipped with white; all have it rounded. All females lack the metallic
throat. The males of the several genera belonging to North America may be
distinguished as follows:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

We have included <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lampornis</i> in the list of United States genera on
exceedingly doubtful evidence of the occurrence of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. mango</i>, which was
said to have been taken at Key West, and sent to Mr. Audubon, who figured
it. The species, however, proves to be one belonging to Brazil, and not the
Jamaican form (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. porphyrura</i>, Gould), which might possibly have straggled
there.</p>

<p>In reference to the large number of species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trochilidæ</i>, it may be well
to remark that many differ by very slight, sometimes quite inappreciable
characters, and are to be looked on as only climatic or geographical varieties.
All those given for the United States are, however, well marked.</p>

<p>Additional species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trochilidæ</i> will doubtless yet be detected within
our limits, especially in Arizona, New Mexico, and Southern Texas, where
almost any of the Mexican table-land species may be looked for, such as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calypte floresi</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calothorax cyanopogon</i>, etc. South Florida will probably yet
furnish to us the Bahaman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Doricha evelynæ</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The habits and manners of the whole family of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trochilidæ</i> are, in
many striking respects, entirely peculiar to themselves, and without any known
correspondence or close resemblance to those of any other kinds of birds,
either in America or elsewhere. This family is found exclusively in America,
<!--489.png--><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 441]</span>
either in the islands or on the continent, and number in all not far from
four hundred species, distributed into various subdivisions and genera, but
all possessing, to a very large degree, the same common peculiarities, of
which the well-known Ruby-throat of eastern North America may be taken
as eminently typical. The habits and peculiarities of this numerous family
have been closely studied, and many valuable facts in relation to them have
been contributed by various naturalists; by none, perhaps, with more intelligent
attention than by the eminent Swiss naturalist, <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> H. de Saussure, in
his visit to the West India Islands and Mexico, to whose observations
we are largely indebted.</p>

<p>On the first visit of this naturalist to a savanna in the island of Jamaica,
he at once noticed what he at first took to be a brilliant green insect,
of rapid flight, approaching him by successive alternations of movements
and pauses, and rapidly gliding among and over the network of interlacing
shrubs. He was surprised by the extraordinary dexterity with which it
avoided the movements of his net, and yet more astonished to find, when he
had captured it, that he had taken a bird, and not an insect.</p>

<p>He soon satisfied himself that this entire family not only have the form
and aspect of insects, but that they have also the same movements, the
same habits, and the same manner of living, with certain insects. Their
flight is exactly like that of an insect, and in this respect they form a remarkably
exceptional group among birds. When we notice their long wings
in our cabinet specimens, we naturally suppose that they use these instruments
of flight in the same manner with the Swallow or the Swift. Yet
investigation shows that, so very far from this, these wings, comparatively so
very long, vibrate even more rapidly than do those of birds with proportionately
the smallest wings, such as the Grebe, the Loon, and the Penguin, and
that, more than this, they vibrate with an intensity so vastly superior, that
they become wholly invisible in the wonderful rapidity of their movements.</p>

<p>The altogether exceptional character of their flight is a subject for never-ceasing
astonishment. Until we actually witness it, we should never conceive
it to be possible for a bird to vibrate its wings with so great a rapidity,
and by them to support itself in the air in the same manner with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anthraces</i>
and other aerial insects. This feat is rendered all the more surprising by the
extreme narrowness of the wing and the comparative weight of the body,
which is quite considerable, on account of the compactness of the flesh and
bones, and the small size of the birds themselves, whose wings displace but
a small quantity of air. The resistance of the air to the stroke of the wing
of a bird should be, not in proportion to the surface of that wing, but to its
square, or even to its cube, if the movement is very rapid. Hence it follows
that a due proportion being required as between the weight of the body and
the surface of this organ, a small bird cannot keep itself poised in the
air except by means of vibrations more rapid than those of a larger kind.
This is, without doubt, one explanation of the fact that Humming-Birds, in
<!--490.png--><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 442]</span>
their flight, are so insect-like. They pass from bush to bush as if suspended
in the air, and pause over each flower, vibrating their wings, in precisely the
same manner with the Sphinxes, and with the same humming sounds.</p>

<p>The flight of the Humming-Bird is of two kinds. One of these is used
for a horizontal movement, and is so rapid that one can hardly follow it
with the eye. This is accompanied by a kind of hissing sound. The other
seems to keep the body in the air immovable, in one spot. For the latter
purpose the bird assumes a position nearly vertical, and beats its wings with
great intensity. These organs must vibrate all the more rapidly, because
the immobility of the body requires a shorter stroke, and therefore the more
frequently repeated. The equilibrium of the body is preserved by the alternate
up and down strokes of the wings, no inconsiderable force being required
to keep its immobility, besides that requisite for neutralizing the
weight of the body.</p>

<p>The Humming-Bird is entirely aerial. They pass with the rapidity of an
arrow, stop, rest for a few seconds on some small branch, and then suddenly
depart with so much rapidity that we cannot trace its flight. They
disappear as if by enchantment. Their life is one of feverish excitement.
They seem to live more intensely than any other being on our globe. From
morning to night they traverse the air in quest of honeyed flowers. They
come like a flash of light, assume a vertical position without any support,
throw their tail forward, expanding it like a fan, vibrating their wings with
such rapidity that they become absolutely invisible, plunging, at the same
time, their thread-like tongues to the bottom of some long corolla, and then
they have gone as suddenly as they came. They are never known to rest
on a branch in order more at their leisure to plunge their tongue into the
flower. Their life is too short for this delay; they are in too great haste;
they can only stop long enough to beat their wings before each flower for a
few seconds, but long enough to reach its bottom and to devour its inhabitants.
When we take into consideration how entirely aerial is their life, and
the prodigious relative force requisite to enable them to keep suspended in
the air during the entire day, almost incessantly, either in rapid motion or
accomplishing the most violent vibrations, we can but be amazed at the
extraordinary powers of flight and endurance they manifest.</p>

<p>The Humming-Bird enjoys even the most tropical heat, avoids shade,
and is easily overcome by cold. Though some travellers speak of having
met with these birds in the depths of forests, Saussure discredits their
statements, having never found any in such situations. They prefer open
flowery fields, meadows, gardens, and shrubbery, delighting to glitter in
the sun’s rays, and to mingle with the swarm of resplendent insects with
which tropical regions abound, and with the habits of which their own so
well accord. Nearly all live in the open sun, only a very few are more or
less crepuscular and never to be seen except very early in the morning or in
the evening twilight.</p>

<p><!--491.png--><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 443]</span>
Mr. Salvin is of the opinion that Humming-Birds do not remain long on
the wing at once, but rest frequently, choosing for that purpose a small dead
or leafless twig at the top, or just within the branches of the tree. While
in this position they trim their feathers and clean their bill, all the time
keeping up an incessant jerking of their wings and tail.</p>

<p>In Mexico, where these birds are very abundant, they are attracted by the
blossoms of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agave americana</i>, and swarm around them like so many
beetles. As they fly, they skim over the fields, rifle the flowers, mingling
with the bees and the butterflies, and during the seasons of bloom, at certain
hours of the day, the fields appear perfectly alive with them. The ear
receives unceasingly the whistling sounds of their flight, and their shrill
cries, resembling in their sharp accent the clash of weapons. Although the
Humming-Bird always migrates at the approach of cold weather, yet it is
often to be found at very considerable elevations. The traveller Bourcier
met with them on the crater of Pichincha, and <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Saussure obtained specimens
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calothorax lucifer</i> in the Sierra de Cuernavaca, at the height of
more than 9,500 feet.</p>

<p>While we must accept as a well-established fact that the Humming-Birds
feed on insects, demonstrated long since by naturalists, it is equally true
that they are very fond of the nectar of flowers, and that this, to a certain
extent, constitutes their nourishment. This is shown by the sustenance
which captive Humming-Birds receive from honey and other sweet substances,
food to which a purely insectivorous bird could hardly adapt itself.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their diminutive size the Humming-Birds are notorious
for their aggressive disposition. They attack with great fury anything that
excites their animosity, and maintain constant warfare with whatever is
obnoxious to them, expressly the Sphinxes or Hawk-Moths. Whenever
one of these inoffensive moths, two or three times the size of a Humming-Bird,
chances to come too early into the garden and encounters one of these
birds, he must give way or meet with certain injury. At sight of the
insect the bird attacks it with his pointed beak with great fury. The
Sphinx, overcome in this unlooked-for attack, beats a retreat, but, soon
returning to the attractive flowers, is again and again assaulted by its infuriated
enemy. Certain destruction awaits these insects if they do not
retire from the field before their delicate wings, lacerated in these attacks,
can no longer support them, and they fall to the ground to perish from other
enemies.</p>

<p>In other things the Humming-Bird also shows itself all the more impertinent
and aggressive that it is small and weak. It takes offence at everything
that moves near it. It attacks birds much larger than itself, and
is rarely disturbed or molested by those it thus assails. All other birds
must make way. It is possible that in some of these attacks it may be influenced
by an instinctive prompting of advantages to be gained, as in the
case of the spider, in whose nets they are liable to be entangled, and whose
<!--492.png--><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 444]</span>
webs often seriously incommode them. When a Humming-Bird perceives a
spider in the midst of its net, it rarely fails to make an attack, and with
such rapidity that one cannot follow the movement, but in the twinkling of
an eye the spider has disappeared. This is not only done to small spiders,
which doubtless they devour, but also to others too large to be thus eaten.</p>

<p>Not content with thus chastising small enemies, the Humming-Bird also
contends with others far more powerful, and which give them a good deal
of trouble. They have been known to engage in an unequal contest with the
Sparrow-Hawk, yet rarely without coming off the conquerors. In this strife
they have the advantage of numbers, their diminutive size, and the rapidity
and the irregularity of their own movements. Several unite in these attacks,
and, in rushing upon their powerful enemy, they always aim at his
eyes. The Hawk soon appreciates his inability to contend with these tormenting
little furies, and beats an ignominious retreat.</p>

<p>Advantage is taken of this aggressive disposition of these birds, by the
hunter, to capture them. In their combats with one another, or in their
rash attacks upon various offensive objects, even upon the person of the
snarer himself, they are made prisoners through their own rashness and
reckless impetuosity.</p>

<p>In enumerating the prominent characteristics of this remarkable family,
we should not omit to refer to the lavish profusion of colors of every tint
and shade, excelling in lustre and brilliancy even the costliest gems, with
which Nature has adorned their plumage. And not only are nearly all the
birds of this group thus decked out with hues of the most dazzling brightness
and splendor, when alive and resplendent in the tropical sun, but many
also display the most wonderfully varying shades and colors, according to
the position in which they are presented to the eye. The sides of the fibres
of each feather are of a different color from the surface, and change as seen
in a front or an oblique direction, and while living, these birds, by their
movements, can cause these feathers to change very suddenly to very different
hues. Thus the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus rufus</i> can change in a twinkling the vivid
fire-color of its expanded throat to a light green, and the species known as
the Mexican Star (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cynanthus lucifer</i>) changes from a bright crimson to an
equally brilliant blue.</p>

<p>The nests and the eggs of the Humming-Birds, though in a few exceptional
cases differing as to the form and position of the former, are similar, so far as
known, in the whole family. The eggs are always two in number, white
and unspotted, oblong in shape, and equally obtuse at either end. The only
differences to be noticed are in the relative variations in size. The nests
are generally saddled upon the upper side of a horizontal branch, are cup-like
in shape, and are largely made up of various kinds of soft vegetable
down, covered by an outward coating of lichens and mosses fastened upon
them by the glue-like saliva of the bird. In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. colubris</i> the soft inner portion
of the nest is composed of the delicate downy covering of the leaf-buds
<!--493.png--><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 445]</span>
of several kinds of oaks. In Georgia the color of this down is of a deep
nankeen hue, but in New England it is nearly always white. At first the nest
is made of this substance alone, and the entire complement of eggs, never
more than two, is sometimes laid before the covering of lichens is put on by
the male bird, who seems to amuse himself with this while his mate is sitting
upon her eggs.</p>

<p>The male bird is easily distinguished from other North American species
by its very small size, the snowy-white bases of the elongated loose throat-feathers,
and by the shape of the tail, as also the absence, at least in the
several males before us, of decided metallic green on the central tail-feathers.
The females resemble those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. heloisæ</i> most closely, but have longer bills
and wings, broader tail-feathers, and their rufous confined to the edges,
instead of crossing the entire basal portion. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus platycercus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rufus</i>
are much larger, and have tails marked more as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. heloisæ</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This interesting species was first met with as a Mexican Humming-Bird,
on the high table-lands of that republic, by Signor Floresi. His
specimens were obtained in the neighborhood of the Real del Monte mines.
As it was a comparatively rare bird, and only met with in the winter
months, it was rightly conjectured to be only a migrant in that locality.</p>

<p>This species is new to the fauna of North America, and was first brought
to the attention of naturalists by Mr. J. K. Lord, one of the British commissioners
on the Northwest Boundary Survey. It is presumed to be a
mountain species, found in the highlands of British Columbia, Washington
Territory, Oregon, California, and Northern Mexico.</p>

<p>Early in May Mr. Lord was stationed on the Little Spokan River, superintending
the building of a bridge. The snow was still remaining in patches,
and no flowers were in bloom except the brilliant pink <i class="name">Ribes</i>, or flowering
currant. Around the blossoms of this shrub he found congregated quite a
number of Humming-Birds. The bushes seemed to him to literally gleam
with their flashing colors. They were all male birds, and of two species;
and upon obtaining several of both they proved to be, one the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus
rufus</i>, the other the present species, one of the smallest of Humming-Birds,
and in life conspicuous for a frill of minute pinnated feathers, encircling the
throat, of a delicate magenta tint, which can be raised or depressed at will.
A few days after the females arrived, and the species then dispersed in
pairs.</p>

<p>He afterwards ascertained that they prefer rocky hillsides at great altitudes,
where only pine-trees, rock plants, and an alpine flora are found. He
frequently shot these birds above the line of perpetual snow. Their favorite
resting-place was on the extreme point of a dead pine-tree, where, if undisturbed,
they would sit for hours. The site chosen for the nest was
usually the branch of a young pine, where it was artfully concealed amidst
the fronds at the very end, and rocked like a cradle by every passing breeze.</p>

<p><!--495.png--><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 447]</span>
Dr. Cooper thinks that he met with this species in August, 1853, on the
summit of the Cascade Mountains, but mistook the specimens for the young
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus rufus</i>.</p>

<p>Early in June, 1859, Mr. John Feilner found these birds breeding near
Pitt River, California, and obtained their nests.</p>

<p>This species was obtained by Mr. Ridgway only on the East Humboldt
Mountains, in Eastern Nevada. The two or three specimens shot were
females, obtained in August and September, and at the time mistaken for
the young of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus platycercus</i>, which was abundant at that locality.</p>

<p>Dr. W. J. Hoffman writes, in relation to this species, that on the 20th of
July, 1871, being in camp at Big Pines, a place about twenty-seven miles
north of Camp Independence, California, on a mountain stream, the banks
of which are covered with an undergrowth of cottonwood and small bushes,
he frequently saw and heard Humming-Birds flying around him. He at
length discovered a nest, which was perched on a limb directly over the
swift current, where it was sometimes subjected to the spray. The limb
was but half an inch in thickness, and the nest was attached to it by means
of thin fibres of vegetable material and hairs. It contained two eggs. The
parents were taken, and proved to be this species. There were many birds
of the same kind at this point, constantly on the tops of the small pines
in search of insects.</p>

broad to the terminal third, where they become
rapidly pointed, the tip only somewhat rounded; the sides of this attenuated
portion (one or other, or both) broadly and concavely emarginated, which distinguishes
them from the females of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calypte</i>, in which the
tail is broadly linear to near the end, which is much rounded without any

much smaller, more linear, and nearly equal in width (about that of inner

skins; others, however, are not distinguishable from the northern specimens.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species is found throughout eastern North America, as far
west as the Missouri Valley, and breeds from Florida and the valley of the
Rio Grande to high northern latitudes. Richardson states that it ranges at
least to the 57th parallel, and probably even farther north. He obtained
specimens on the plains of the Saskatchewan, and Mr. Drummond found
one of its nests near the source of the Elk River. Mr. Dresser found this
bird breeding in Southwestern Texas, and also resident there during the
winter months, and I have received their nests and eggs from Florida and
Georgia. It was found by Mr. Skinner to be abundant in Guatemala during
the winter months, on the southern slope of the great Cordillera, showing
that it chooses for its winter retreat the moderate climate afforded by a region
lying between the elevations of three and four thousand feet, where
it winters in large numbers. Mr. Salvin noted their first arrival in
Guatemala as early as the 24th of August. From that date the number
rapidly increased until the first week in October, when it had become by
far the most common species about Dueñas. It seemed also to be universally
distributed, being equally common at Coban, at San Geronimo, and the
plains of Salamá.</p>

<p>The birds of this species make their appearance on our southern border
late in March, and slowly move northward in their migrations, reaching
Upper Georgia about the 10th of April, Pennsylvania from the last of
April to about the middle of May, and farther north the last of May or the
first of June. They nest in Massachusetts about the 10th of June, and are
about thirteen days between the full number of eggs and the appearance of
the young. They resent any approach to their nest, and will even make
angry movements around the head of the intruder, uttering a sharp outcry.
Other than this I have never heard them utter any note.</p>

<p>Attempts to keep in confinement the Humming-Bird have been only partially
successful. They have been known to live, at the best, only a few
months, and soon perish, partly from imperfect nourishment and unsuitable
food, and probably also from insufficient warmth.</p>

<p>Numerous examinations of stomachs of these birds, taken in a natural
state, demonstrate that minute insects constitute a very large proportion of
their necessary food. These are swallowed whole. The young birds feed
by putting their own bills down the throats of their parents, sucking probably
a prepared sustenance of nectar and fragments of insects. They raise,
I think, but one brood in a season. The young soon learn to take care of
themselves, and appear to remain some time after their parents have left.
They leave New England in September, and have all passed southward beyond
our limits by November.</p>

<p>A nest of this bird, from Dr. Gerhardt, of Georgia, measures 1.75 inches
in its external diameter and 1.50 in height. Its cavity measures 1.00
<!--500.png--><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 450]</span>
in depth and 1.25 inches in breadth. It is of very homogeneous construction,
the material of which it is made being almost exclusively a substance
of vegetable origin, resembling wool, coarse in fibre, but soft, warm,
and yielding, of a deep buff color. This is strengthened, on the outside, by
various small woody fibres; the whole, on the outer surface, entirely and
compactly covered by a thatching of small lichens, a species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parmelia</i>.</p>

<p>A nest obtained in Lynn, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, by Mr. George O. Welch, in June, 1860,
was built on a horizontal branch of an apple-tree. <a name="note36" id="note36"></a>It measures 1.50 inches
in height, and 2.25 in its external diameter. The cavity is more shallow,
measuring .70 of an inch in depth and 1.00 in diameter. It is equally
homogeneous in its composition, being made of very similar materials. In
this case, however, the soft woolly material of which it is woven is finer in
fibre, softer and more silky, and of the purest white color. It is strengthened
on the base with pieces of bark, and on the sides with fine vegetable
fibres. The whole nest is beautifully covered with a compact coating of
lichens, a species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parmelia</i>, but different from those of the Georgian nest.</p>

<p>The fine silk-like substance of which the nest from Lynn is chiefly composed
is supposed to be the soft down which appears on the young and
unexpanded leaves of the red-oak, immediately before their full development.
The buds of several of the oaks are fitted for a climate liable to
severe winters, by being protected by separate downy scales surrounding
each leaf. In Massachusetts the red-oak is an abundant tree, expands its
leaves at a convenient season for the Humming-Bird, and these soft silky
scales which have fulfilled their mission of protection to the embryo leaves
are turned to a good account by our tiny and watchful architect. The species
in Georgia evidently make use of similar materials from one of the
southern oaks.</p>

<p>The eggs measure .50 by .35 of an inch, and are of a pure dull white.</p>

The chief characters of this species are to be found in the violet,
steel-blue, or steel-green reflections of the hinder part of the gorget, varying
with the situation of the feathers and the specimen, as distinguished
from the bright fiery or coppery red of the other. The chin and upper
part of the throat extending beneath the eyes
are opaque velvety or greenish black, without
metallic lustre, while in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. colubris</i> it is only the
extreme chin which is thus dull in appearance.
The bill is about .10 of an inch longer, the tail
less deeply forked, and tinged with green at the
end.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly difficult to distinguish the female of this species from
that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. colubris</i>. The size is rather
larger, and the tail rounded, without any
distinct emargination; the middle feathers
being .15 of an inch longer than the lateral
ones, instead of actually shorter. The
color is much the same. The primaries
are also much broader in the present species.</p>

<p>In both species the outer tail-feathers,
though broader than in the male, are quite
acutely pointed on the terminal third, one
side or the other of which is slightly concave, instead of being linear to near
the end, and rounded without any concavity, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calypte</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This Humming-Bird, originally described as a Mexican species,
is found from the highlands of that republic northward, not only to the
southern borders of the western United States, but as far north as the 58th
parallel. It was first discovered on the table-lands of Mexico, east of the
city, by Signor Floresi, a distinguished naturalist, who devoted himself to
the study of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trochilidæ</i> of Mexico, but was first added to the fauna of
North America by Dr. Heermann, who detected it, and obtained several
specimens, within the burying-ground of Sacramento City, <abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr> There several
pairs remained during the period of incubation, and reared their young,
finding both food and shelter among the flowering plants of that cemetery.
He found several of their nests which were essentially similar to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T.
colubris</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper met with this species along the Mohave River. He saw the
first on the <abbr title="third">3d</abbr> of June. He also found one of their nests built in a dark
willow-thicket in the fork of a tree, eight feet from the ground. Those
afterwards found near Santa Barbara were all built near the end of hanging
branches of the sycamore, constructed of white down from willow catkins,
agglutinated by the bird’s saliva, and thus fastened to the branch on which
it rested. These were built in the latter part of April, and early in May
<!--502.png--><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 452]</span>
contained two eggs, exactly resembling those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. colubris</i>, and measuring
.51 by .32 of an inch.</p>

<p>Afterwards Mr. W. W. Holden obtained a specimen in the Colorado Valley,
March 20.</p>

<p>Mr. J. K. Lord, one of the English commissioners of the Northwestern
Boundary Survey, met with this species near his camping-place on the western
slope of the Rocky Mountains. This was near a lake, by the margin of
which, with other trees, grew a number of the black birch. On these trees
he found a sweet gummy sap exuding plentifully from splits in the bark,
and on this sap hosts of insects, large and small, were regaling themselves.
As the sap was very sticky, numbers of the smaller winged insects were
trapped in it. Busily employed in picking off and devouring these captive
insects were several very sombre-looking Humming-Birds, poising themselves
over the flowers, and nipping off, as with delicate forceps, the imprisoned
insects. Upon securing one of these birds, he ascertained that it
belonged to this species. This was pretty satisfactory proof that they are
insect-eaters. Not only on this occasion, but many times afterwards, Mr.
Lord saw this bird pick the insects from the tree; and the stomachs of those
he killed, on being opened, were filled with various kinds of winged insects.
He found this bird lingering around lakes, pools, and swamps, where these
birches grow. They generally build in the birch or alder, selecting the fork
of a branch high up.</p>

<p>This species bears a very close resemblance in size, appearance, and markings,
to the common eastern species, but is readily distinguishable by the
difference in the color of the chin and the shape of the tail.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1851, on a trip to Sonora, Mexico, Dr. Heermann found
these birds abundant in the arid country around Guaymas, where amid the
scanty vegetation they had constructed their nests in the month of April.
He also afterwards found them on Dry Creek and the Cosumnes River.</p>

<p>According to the observations of Mr. Ridgway, this species has quite an
extended distribution in the West. He found it in varying abundance from
the Sacramento Valley, in California, to the Wahsatch and Uintah Mountains
in Utah.</p>

<p>At Sacramento it was more abundant than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. anna</i>, nesting in the
door-yards and in gardens, but particularly in the thick copses of small oaks
in the outskirts of the city. In the Great Basin it associated with the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus rufus</i> in the western portion, and with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. platycercus</i> to the eastward,
nesting everywhere, from the lowest valleys to a height of eight or
nine thousand feet in the mountains.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. floresi</i> of the table-lands of
Mexico resembles this species in every
respect except the tail, which is somewhat
like that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus rufus</i>. The
only North American species to which the
male of this bird bears any resemblance is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">A. costæ</i>, which has the same
metallic crown and other generic features. The latter, however, is much
smaller; has the metallic reflections varied,
chiefly violet, instead of nearly uniform purplish-red.
The tail is much less deeply forked,
the depth being only about .10 of an inch, instead
of .32; the outer feather is much narrower.
The females of the two, however,
appear to be distinguishable only by their
relative size. The absence of rufous, and the
rounded, not graduated, tail always separates the female of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">anna</i> from that
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus rufus</i>. The larger size is the chief distinction from the
female <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calypte costæ</i>, while the size and less acutely pointed outer tail-feathers
distinguish it from the female <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trochilus colubris</i>.</p>

<p>We have never seen any specimens of this bird taken out of California,
nor quoted of late years as occurring in Mexico, although stated by Gould to
belong to the table-lands.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This beautiful Humming-Bird is found from the high table-lands
of Mexico throughout the western portions of that region, and through
<!--505.png--><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 455]</span>
all the coast country of California, from the slopes of the Sierra to the
ocean. It was first taken in Mexico, and named in honor of Anna, Duchess
of Rivoli. Mr. Nuttall was the first of our own naturalists to take it within
our territory. He captured a female on its nest near Santa Barbara. This
was described and figured by Audubon. The nest was attached to a small
burnt twig of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Photinia</i>, and was small for the bird, being only 1.25 inches in
breadth. It was somewhat conic in shape, made of the down of willow catkins,
intermixed with their scales, and a few feathers, the latter forming the
lining. It had none of the neatness of the nests of our common species,
and was so rough on the outside that Mr. Nuttall waited several days in
expectation of its being completed, and found the female sitting on two
eggs when he caught her. Dr. Cooper, however, thinks this description
applies much better to the nest of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. alexandri</i>, as all that he has seen of
this species are twice as large, and covered externally with lichens, even
when on branches not covered with these parasites.</p>

<p><a name="note24" id="note24"></a>Dr. Gambel, in his paper published in 1846 on the birds of California,
describes this as a very abundant species, numbers of which pass the entire
winter in California. At such times he found them inhabiting sheltered
hillsides and plains, where, at all seasons, a few bushy plants were in flower
and furnished them with a scanty subsistence. In the latter part of February
and during March they appeared in greater numbers. About the Pueblo
the vineyards and the gardens were their favorite resort, where they build a
delicate downy nest in small flowering bushes, or in a concealed spot about
a fence. In April and May they may be seen in almost every garden.</p>

<p>In the wilder portions of the country Dr. Gambel found them attaching
their nest almost exclusively to low horizontal branches of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quercus agrifolia</i>,
or evergreen oak, so common in that region. The nest he describes
as small, only about an inch in depth, and 1.25 inches in diameter, formed in
the most delicate manner of pappus and down of various plants matted into
a soft felt, with spider’s-webs, which he frequently observed them collecting
for the purpose, in the spring, along hedges and fence-rows. The base of
the nest is formed of a few dried male aments of the oak, which, with the
adjoining felt-like matting of pappus, are agglutinated and bound around
the twig with a thick layer of spider’s-webs. The note of this bird, he
states, is a slender <i class="birdcall">chep</i>, frequently repeated. During the breeding-season
they are very pugnacious, darting like meteors among the trees, uttering a
loud and repeated twittering scold. They also have the habit of ascending
to a considerable height, and then of descending with great rapidity, uttering
at the same time a peculiar cry. The glutinous pollen of a tubular flower
upon which these birds feed often adheres to the rigid feathers of the crown,
and causes the bird to seem to have a bright yellow head. Nuttall, who
never obtained the male of this species, but saw them in this condition, supposed
this to be a yellow spot in the crown, and hence his supposed species
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">icterocephalus</i>.</p>

<p><!--506.png--><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 456]</span>
In California, south of San Francisco, this species was also observed, by
Dr. Cooper, to be a constant resident in mild winters, remaining among the
foot-hills of the Sierra Nevada, at least fifteen hundred feet above the sea.
There he has found them quite common in February. At that season flowers,
and consequently insects, are more abundant than in the dry summers.
The males are in fine plumage early in January.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper states that the nests of this species are built at various heights
and positions, often in gardens, and sometimes on dead branches, without
any attempt at concealment except the outside covering of lichens. He
has found them made almost wholly of mosses, with only a lining of
feathers and down of plants. In the neighborhood of San Francisco the
young are sometimes hatched as early as the middle of March. This species
appears to be more hardy than the others, being common along the coast
border, though Dr. Cooper saw none near the summits of the Sierra Nevada.</p>

<p>The notes of the male bird, he states, are like the sound produced by the
filing of a saw or the whetting of a scythe. They enter familiarly into the
city of San Francisco, and even venture into rooms, attracted by the flowers.
They are bold and confident, approach to within a few feet of man, but at
the least motion disappear like a flash.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann found this species quite common at San Diego in March,
and in its full spring plumage. In September he procured a number of
specimens on a small island in the Cosumnes River. While on the wing
in pursuit of insects, or after alighting on a small branch, he heard them
utter a very weak twitter, continued for a minute or more.</p>

<p>A nest of this species from Petaluma is about 1.50 inches in diameter,
and 1.00 in height, and bears no resemblance to the one described by Nuttall.
It is made of a commingling of mosses and vegetable down, covered
externally with a fine yellow lichen. The eggs measure .60 by .40 of an
inch, and are about ten per cent larger than those of any other North
American Humming-Bird.</p>

<p>Another nest of this Humming-Bird, obtained in Petaluma, <abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>, by Mr.
Emanuel Samuels, measures 1.75 inches in diameter, and about 1.00 in
height. Its cavity is one inch in diameter at the rim, and half an inch in
depth. Its lining is composed of such soft materials that its limits are not
well defined. The base of the nest is made of feathers, mosses, and lichens
of several varieties of the smaller kinds. The periphery and rim of the nest
are of nearly the same materials. The inner fabric consists of a mass of a
dirty-white vegetable wool, with a lining of the very finest and softest of
feathers, intermingled with down from the seeds of some species of silkweed.
The predominant lichen in the base and sides of the nest is the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ramalina menziesii</i>, which is peculiar to California. The nest contained a
single egg.</p>

Tail very slightly emarginated and rounded; exterior feather very narrow,
and linear. A very long ruff on each side of the throat. Head above and below, with
the ruff, covered with metallic red, purple and violet (sometimes steel green). Remaining
upper parts and sides of the body green. Throat under and between the ruffs, side
of head behind the eye, anal region, and under tail-coverts whitish. Female with the tail
rounded, scarcely emarginate; barred with black, and tipped with white. The metallic
colors of the head wanting. Length, 3.20; wing, 1.75; tail, 1.10; bill, .68.</p>

<p>Specimens vary considerably in the color of the ruff, which, however, is
only occasionally green; violet being the prevailing shade. The length of
this appendage varies considerably.</p>

<p>The female of this species differs much from the male in the absence of
the metallic scales on the head and throat. It has a close resemblance to
the female <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. colubris</i>, although the bill is smaller and narrower. The tail-feathers
are narrower, more linear, and less acutely pointed at the tip. The
black on the outer tail-feathers, instead of extending very nearly to the
base, is confined to the terminal half, the basal portion being green. All
the tail-feathers are terminated by white, although that on the fourth and
fifth is very narrow. In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. colubris</i> this color is confined to the three outer
ones. The much smaller size will alone distinguish it from the female
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. anna</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species is a Mexican bird, first discovered by Signor Floresi
among the valleys of the Sierra Madre, in that country, throughout the western
portions of which it is said to be an abundant species, as well as
along our southern borders, whence it extends into New Mexico, the Colorado
Valley, Southern California, and Arizona. It was first described by
Bourcier in 1839, and named in honor of the Marquis de Costa, of Chambery.</p>

<p>Mr. Xantus found this species exceedingly abundant at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas.
It has also been found on the eastern coast of the Gulf of California, at
Guaymas, and Mazatlan, and also on the table-lands of Mexico.</p>

<p>It was first added to our fauna by Dr. Kennerly, who obtained specimens
near Bill Williams Fork, in New Mexico, February 9, 1854. At that early
season a few flowers had already expanded beneath the genial rays of the
sun, and around them the party rarely failed to find these beautiful birds.
<!--508.png--><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 458]</span>
They had already paired, and were constantly to be seen hovering over the
flowers. Their notes consisted of a rapid chirping sound. As Dr. Kennerly’s
party approached the coast of California, where the valleys abounded with
flowers of every hue, these birds continued flitting before them in great numbers.
Dr. Coues states that this species was not taken at Fort Whipple, though
abundantly distributed throughout the Territory, particularly in its southern
and southwestern portions, and found about fifty miles south of Prescott.
It is presumed to winter within the Territory, and also within the valley of
the Colorado. Dr. Cooper did not observe any at Fort Mohave until March
5, and they were not numerous afterwards. At San Diego, in 1862, when
the spring was unusually backward, he saw none before April 22, and he has
since met with them as far north as San Francisco, where, however, they are
rare. The notes uttered by the male he compares to the highest and sharpest
note that can be drawn from a violin. Nothing more is known as to their
distinctive specific peculiarities.</p>

<p>As already stated, the characters of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus</i>, as distinguished from
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calypte</i> (to which it is most nearly related, through the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. floresi</i>), consist in
the lack of metallic feathers on the crown, and
in the attenuation of the outer primary, and the
pointed and acuminate cuneate (instead of
forked) tail.</p>

<p>As distinguished from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trochilus</i>, the quills
diminish gradually, instead of showing an abrupt
transition between the fourth and fifth, so

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This brilliant species has an extended distribution throughout
the western part of North America, being found from the valley of the Rio
Grande to the Pacific, and from Mexico to
Sitka. It was first discovered near Nootka
Sound, by that distinguished navigator, Captain
Cook, and described by Latham, and has
been met with as far to the south as Real del
Monte, on the table-lands of Mexico, by Mr.
Taylor, whose specimens were described by
Mr. Swainson.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found it very abundant at Arizona,
near Fort Whipple, as it is also along the whole slope of the Rocky
Mountains. It is a summer resident in that Territory, and breeds there abundantly,
arriving at Fort Whipple April 10, and remaining until the middle
of September, being found in all situations, particularly meadows, open
copses, ravines, etc., where flowers are most abundant.</p>

<p>Mr. Dall gives them as common summer residents at Sitka. Bischoff
obtained sixteen specimens. Dr. Suckley says they are very abundant in
the western provinces of both Oregon and Washington Territory, and in
Vancouver Island. They appear to be very hardy, and are one of the earliest
of the migratory birds to arrive in spring. At Fort Steilacoom, latitude
47<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, they appeared April 10. They are supposed to commence their southern
migrations from that region in September,&mdash;a move induced by the
scarcity of flowers and lack of means of captivating insects, rather than by
cold. In Washington Territory their incubation commences about the 10th
of May, and is made evident by the fierce and angry battles continually occurring
between the male birds, in which they tilt at each other at full
speed, at the same time keeping up a loud and vociferous squeaking and
buzzing.</p>

<p>A nest with eggs, of this species, obtained by Dr. Cooper near Fort
Slaughter, May 23, was found in the forked branch of a snowberry-bush.
It was composed principally of fine green moss, lined internally with the
delicate floss of the cottonwood, and externally bordered most artistically
with rock lichens. The female was on the nest, and allowed so near an approach
as almost to admit of being grasped by the hand. The nest was 2.00
inches in diameter and 1.50 in height. The eggs measured .45 by .33 of an
inch, and were white, as in all the species.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper states that the appearance of this species at the Straits of
Fuca is coincident with the blossoming of the red-flowering currant, which
begins to bloom on the Columbia March 10. The male of this species has
a remarkable habit, when a stranger or a wild animal approaches its nest, of
rising to a great height in the air, and of then darting down perpendicularly
<!--511.png--><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 461]</span>
upon the intruder, producing a hollow rushing sound, like that of the Night-Hawk,
but of a much sharper tone. These sounds are produced by the
wings. In July, when flowers are more abundant among the mountain summits,
they leave the lower country. Dr. Cooper found them abundant in
August at an elevation of nearly six thousand feet, and where ice was
formed at night in their camp.</p>

<p>In California, Dr. Cooper has not found any of this species remaining in
winter, even at San Diego, where, however, he has known them to arrive as
early as the 5th of February. He also saw several on the <abbr title="twenty-second">22d</abbr> of the same
month feeding among the flowers of the evergreen gooseberry. By the first
of April they were swarming about San Diego. Their young are hatched
before the middle of June. When perching, this species is said to utter a
shrill wiry call, like the highest note of a violin. They also produce a curious
kind of bleating sound. They are among the most noisy and lively of
their race, are very quarrelsome, chase each other away from favorite flowers,
rising into the air until out of sight, chirping as they go in the most excited
manner.</p>

<p>Mr. Lord noticed the arrival of this species at Little Spokan River, in
latitude 49<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, early in May. He found their nests usually in low shrubs and
close to rippling streams. The females of this and other species are said to
arrive about a week later than the males.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann for several successive seasons found many pairs of these
birds breeding in the vicinity of San Francisco.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall compares the appearance of the male birds of this species,
when he approached too near their nests, to an angry coal of brilliant fire,
as they darted upon him, passing within a few inches of his face as they
returned again and again to the attack, making a sound as of a breaking
twig.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse, who found this bird abundant in New Mexico, particularly
in the vicinity of Santa Fé, speaks of the great noise they make for so
small a bird, and of their quarrelsome and pugnacious disposition.</p>

<p>Mr. R. Brown, in his synopsis of the birds of Vancouver Island, notes the
appearance of this species, from the end of March to the beginning of May,
according to the state of the season. Its nest was built on the tips of low
bushes, or the under branches of trees. This was the only species of Humming-Bird
seen west of the Cascade Mountains.</p>

<p>The Rufous Hummer was first noticed by Mr. Ridgway in the valley of the
Truckee River, in August, where it was the only species shot, and was extremely
abundant among the sunflowers which ornament the meadows. In
May of the succeeding year, when the same locality was again visited, not
one of this species was to be found, its place being apparently supplied by
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. alexandri</i>, which was quite common, and breeding. Eastward it was
met with as far as the East Humboldt Mountains, where, however, only a
single pair was seen, and one of them shot, in September.</p>

<p>A decided character of this species among its North American relatives is
the rufous outer border of the exterior tail-feathers. This rufous in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. rufus</i>
pervades most of the feathers, instead of being restricted as above. Females
of the two species are not dissimilar: those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. platycercus</i> are larger, less
rufous beneath; the tail-feathers broader and less pointed, and with the
inner two (on each side) entirely green to base (the fourth edged with
rufous), instead of being principally rufous, except at tip.</p>

<p>Specimens from Mirador, Mexico, are undistinguishable from those of
Fort Bridger; those from Guatemala are smaller than the Mexican.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Until recently this Humming-Bird has been presumed to be an
exclusively Mexican and Central American species. Until taken within our
limits, it had been supposed to be confined on the north to the Mexican plateau,
<!--513.png--><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 463]</span>
westward to the city, and thence southward to Guatemala, while throughout
this region it is said to be very generally and very plentifully distributed.
It was first taken, in 1851, by Mr. J. H. Clark, near El Paso, Texas. Subsequently
numerous specimens were seen by Dr. Coues on the summit of
Whipple’s Pass of the Rocky Mountains, in July, feeding among clumps
of wild roses. It was not noticed near Fort Whipple, though the range
of this species is now well known to include New Mexico and Arizona, as
far north, at least, as Fort Bridger in Wyoming. It was found breeding
abundantly in the vicinity of Fort Grant, Arizona, by Dr. Palmer.</p>

<p>This Humming-Bird was found by Mr. Allen more or less common among
the foot-hills, as well as among the mountains, of Colorado, and extending
several miles out on the plains. On Mount Lincoln, in Colorado, he found
it exceedingly numerous, and though larger and otherwise different from the
eastern Ruby-throat, it might easily be mistaken for it. The shrill whistling
of its wings, he adds, is a peculiarity one is sure to notice. This Humming-Bird
continued to be common on the sides of Mount Lincoln to far above
the timber line, being apparently as much at home among the bright flowers
growing on the highest parts of the mountain as in the valleys.</p>

<p>At Lake Tahoe, at an elevation of six thousand feet, Dr. Cooper found
the young of this species quite common near the middle of September.
Supposing them to be the more common <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. rufus</i>, he only obtained a single
specimen. He thinks that these birds extend their northern migrations as
far as the Blue Mountains, near Snake River, Oregon, and that they are the
ones referred to by Nuttall as seen by him in autumn, and supposed to be
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rufus</i>.</p>

<p>The nests of this species procured by Dr. Palmer were large for the size
of the bird, unusually broad and shallow, composed of soft downy pappus
from seeds of plants, and vegetable down, with the outer walls covered with
mosses and lichens. The eggs are not distinguishable from those of the
other species.</p>

<p>The Rocky Mountain or Broad-tailed Hummer, according to Mr. Ridgway’s
observations, is the most abundant species in the Great Basin, though
he did not see it to recognize it west of the East Humboldt Mountains. It
is essentially a bird of the mountains, since in that region there are few
flowers elsewhere; yet in the gardens of Salt Lake City, an altitude far below
its usual habitat, it was abundant. Its favorite resorts are the flowery
slopes of the higher and well-watered mountain-ranges of the Great Basin
and Rocky Mountain system, at an average elevation of about eight or
nine thousand feet, yet it will be found wherever flowers are abundant.
Mr. Ridgway saw one at an altitude of about twelve thousand feet, in July,
on the East Humboldt Mountains, but it merely passed rapidly by him. In
the Wahsatch Mountains, particularly in the neighborhood of Salt Lake
City, this species was most plentiful. It there nested abundantly in the
scrub-oaks on the hills or slopes of the cañons.</p>

<p><!--514.png--><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 464]</span>
The male bird is very pugnacious, and was observed to attack and drive
away an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Accipiter fuscus</i>, the Hawk retreating as rapidly as possible. When
the nest is approached, the male often rises high into the air and then sweeps
down almost to the head of the intruder, its swift descent being accompanied
by a very peculiar shrill, screeching buzz, of an extraordinary degree
of loudness to be produced by so small a creature. The same sound Mr.
Ridgway noticed when the bird was passing overhead, in a manner not observed
in any other species, its horizontal flight being by a peculiar undulating
course. The shrill noise made by the male of this species he suggests
may be caused by the curious attenuated and stiffened outer primary. He
noticed a curious piece of ingenuity in nest-making on the part of this species.
The nest in question was fastened upon a dead twig of a small cottonwood-tree;
the loosening bark, which probably had separated after the nest was
finished, had allowed the nest to turn around so as to hang beneath the
branch, thus spilling the eggs upon the ground. The owners, however, built
another nest upon the top of the branch, fastening its sides to that of the
old one, and making the new nest lighter and less bulky, so that the weight
of the older nest kept the other in a permanently upright position.</p>

Size very diminutive; bill short, scarcely longer than the head. Outer
primary attenuated nearly as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus</i>; the tail graduated, the feathers, however,
not lanceolate-acute, but rounded at end, and tipped with
white in the male.</p>

<p>This genus seems closely related to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus</i>,
agreeing in character of throat, the curious
attenuation of outer primary, and the general
shape of the tail, with its rufous base and edging.
The feathers, however, are not lanceolate
and pointed, either sharply as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. rufus</i>, or obtusely
as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">platycercus</i>, but are more equal to near the end, where they round
off. The white tip of the tail in the male seems to be the principal reason
why Mr. Gould removes the single species from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus</i>, where it was
previously placed by him, and where perhaps it might have not inappropriately
remained.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Southern New Mexico and Texas, to Guatemala.</p>

<p>The introduction of this species into the fauna of the United States is
based on a female specimen collected by Mr. J. H. Clark at El Paso, Texas,
and for a time supposed to be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus rufus</i>, but after a careful examination
by Mr. Lawrence, pronounced to belong to this species. Its range is
southward along the highlands to Guatemala.</p>

<p>The species is very much like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus</i> in shape, and hardly differs
more than <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. rufus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">platycercus</i> do from each other. The male is easily
distinguished from its allies; the females are closely related to those of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rufus</i>, differing in much shorter bill (.55 to .65), much less rufous on the
more nearly even tail, with broader feathers, etc.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species claims a place within the fauna of North America,
probably only as an accidental visitor, on the ground of a single specimen,&mdash;a
female, taken by Mr. J. H. Clark at El Paso, Texas. It was at first mistaken
for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus rufus</i>. It is a Mexican and Central American species,
ranging throughout the highlands at least as far to the south as Guatemala,
where it was taken by Mr. Salvin.</p>

<p>It was first discovered on the highlands of Mexico by Mr. Delattre, who
procured his specimens between Jalapa and Quatepu. It is crepuscular in
its habits, collecting its food only in the morning or in the evening. Mr.
Delattre states that the male bird is known to rise very early in the morning,
and is never seen in quest of food later than nine in the forenoon. It
very seldom goes to any distance from its mate or young, seeming to prefer
to frequent the flowers in the edge of forests, but does not disdain those of
the open fields. Mr. Salvin received specimens of this species taken in a
<!--516.png--><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 466]</span>
place called Chimachoyo near Calderas, in the Volcan de Fuego, and other

Bill longer than head, depressed, broad at its exposed base; the frontal
feathers not advancing forward beyond the beginning of the nostrils, nor so far as those
of the chin. Hind toe shorter than the lateral,
tarsi feathered; outer primary not attenuated.
Tail nearly even, slightly rounded and emarginate,
the feathers broad, the webs nearly even. Metallic
feathers of throat not elongated. Female quite
similar in form.</p>

<p>This genus is quite peculiar among those
of North America in the exposure of the
base of bill, which is entirely bare between
the lengthened nostrils, instead of covered
by the frontal feathers. This makes the
bill appear very broad, although it really
is more so than in the other genera. The feathers on the chin extend considerably
beyond those of the forehead, instead of to about the same line.
The tail and its feathers are much broader than in the other genera.</p>

characters:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

behind the eye. Throat and forepart of breast brilliant
metallic green; rest of under parts cinnamon-rufous;
all the tail-feathers purplish-rufous,&mdash;the central

Forehead and all under parts light cinnamon beneath,

white cheek-stripe appreciable, but tinged with rufous.
Tail as in male, but the central feathers entirely green

<p>This well-marked and interesting species we owe to Mr. Xantus, together
with many other birds of the west coast. It is sufficiently distinct to require
no comparison other than that given under the general head; it can be separated
from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. melanotis</i> in all stages of plumage by the rufous tail.</p>

<p>Specimens vary sometimes in the intensity of the rufous shade, and, as
stated, it is probable that the forehead, instead of being black, in full plumage
is deep blue, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">melanotis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This is a new and well-marked species, and although belonging
to the North American fauna cannot be claimed for the United States, having
thus far been only taken at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas by Mr. Xantus, and described
by Mr. Lawrence in 1860. Nothing is known as to its specific habits.</p>

Very similar in general form to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Heliopædica</i>, but the tail emarginated,
instead of rounded, the feathers narrower and less rounded at the ends. The coloration
quite different. Sexes alike, in all the species. Color nearly uniform green, with the
anal region white, the wings and tail dusky. Many species with the whole lower parts,
except laterally, pure white. One species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. chionurus</i>) with the tail white, except the
ends of the feathers and the intermediæ.</p>

<p>The species are all of rather small size and rather plain appearance, from
the uniformity of their green, or green and white, coloring. They belong to
northern South America, and to Central America north to Guatemala.</p>

<p>The genus is included in the North American fauna solely upon the
accidental occurrence of one species (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">T. linnæi</i>) in Eastern Massachusetts.</p>

to have been shot by Mr. William Brewster in the summer of 1868, in Cambridge,
near Mount Auburn. It was secured by accident, and was presumed
to be, when taken, a female specimen of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Trochilus colubris</i>. It was sent to
Mr. Vickary, of Lynn, to be mounted, and the question has been raised if
by chance a South American bird may not have been substituted for the
original. This, however, Mr. Vickary is positive could not have happened.
Nothing distinctive was observed as to its habits. In view, however, of the
possibility of an error, the propriety of including it in our fauna is very
questionable.</p>

<p>This remarkable genus is represented in the United States by a single
species, known as the Paisano, Chaparral Cock, or sometimes Road-Runner,

species occurs in Mexico, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Geococcyx affinis</i> of Hartlaub. This is smaller,
and differently proportioned. In both the feathers above are bronzed brown

There are seemingly no differences of plumage depending on sex, age, or
season.</p>

<p>In calling this species <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Geococcyx californianus</i> we do not feel entirely sure
that we have selected the earliest name. Hartlaub and other authors give
1829 as the date of Lesson’s <abbr title="Volume Six">Vol. VI</abbr>, of complement to Buffon (<abbr title="Six">VI</abbr>, 420).
A copy of this volume in the Library of Congress bears date of 1834 upon
the titlepage. It is, however, quoted at the date of 1829 by Engelmann,
so that the copy referred to above may possibly be a second edition, or with
a new post-dated titlepage. In this uncertainty, however, we prefer to

<p>Botta, in his description of the bird (the original of Lesson’s species),
speaks of it as occurring from Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas to San Francisco. Specimens
from Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas, brought by Mr. Xantus, are smaller than those of
Upper California, but otherwise apparently identical.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This very remarkable bird, variously named, in Mexico, Texas,
and California, the Paisano, the Road-Runner, the Chaparral Cock, the Ground
Cuckoo, the Prairie Cock, and the Corre-camino, is one of the most curious
and interesting of the recent additions to our ornithological lists. It is found
throughout Northern Mexico, Texas as far north as Port Chadbourne, and in
California as far as Fort Reading. It is also abundant in portions of Arizona
and New Mexico, and is supposed to be resident in all these districts. It
is described as very remarkable for great swiftness of foot, in which it
appears to be equalled by no other North American bird. In Mexico, and
in some parts of the United States, it is not unusual to hunt these birds,
as a matter of amusement, on horseback, and to pursue them with hounds,&mdash;a
test of their fleetness in which they are said to often make a longer race
than their pursuers anticipated.</p>

<p>This bird habitually frequents the ground. When walking or running, its
long tail is borne in an erect position, and often assumes a variety of grotesque
positions. While thus more or less terrestrial in its habits, and sharing with
gallinaceous birds many of their peculiarities, it has no other affinities with
them, but ranks in a very different ornithological division, being classed with
the Cuckoos.</p>

<p>This bird was first brought to the attention of American naturalists by
Dr. William Gambel, who published a description of it in 1845. Two years
afterwards Colonel McCall published the first satisfactory account that has
been given of its habits and manners of life. He states that though this
bird is zygodactyle, with toes disposed in opposite pairs, yet that the reversibility
of the outer toe favors its use for climbing or perching, as well as for
movements on the ground.</p>

<p>The food of the Ground Cuckoo consists of coleopterous and almost every
other description of insects, and where snails abound they also are greedily
eaten. These are usually taken either from the ground or a branch, and carried
to a particular spot, where the shell is broken and its contents eaten.
<!--524.png--><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 474]</span>
Piles of these shells are often found thus collected in places frequented by
them. They are also said to be ready and expert in catching their prey in
the air, sometimes springing up to the height of eight or ten feet. In these
performances the wings and tail are expanded for but a moment, the bill is
heard to snap as the insect is seized, and the bird drops again suddenly to
the ground.</p>

<p>Colonel McCall adds that the general impression that its powers of flight
are very limited is not correct. When suddenly alarmed in open ground, it
rises with a light quick motion, and flies some hundreds of yards continuously
with an ease that attests its ability to maintain even a longer flight.
He has often seen it climb to the top of a straight leafless branch, and there
sit, apparently to enjoy the first rays of the morning sun.</p>

<p>They are shy and retiring in disposition, wary, vigilant, and cautious, so
that it is generally difficult to approach them on the open ground. When
suddenly surprised and driven to fly a considerable distance for cover, though
they fly with evident ease, they rarely rise higher than six or eight feet from
the ground. In evidence of its wonderful swiftness of foot, Colonel McCall
states that when on one occasion, approaching Limpia Creek, in Texas, with
a small party, he discovered a Chaparral Cock in the open road, about a
hundred yards in advance, for his amusement he put spurs to his horse, and
dashed after the bird with one of the men. It was thus pursued for full four
hundred yards along a smooth and level road, over which with straightened
neck and slightly expanded wings it swiftly glided without seeming to
touch the ground. When at last it sought shelter in the thicket, they had
not gained upon it more than fifty yards.</p>

<p>Captain McCown kept a young half-grown bird in confinement, but it refused
to eat, and soon died; others, however, have been more fortunate, and
have succeeded in taming them.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann states that the stomachs of all these birds examined by
him were filled with the grasshoppers and the large black beetles found on
the plains. A nest of this bird was found by him, built on the branches
of the cactus, and constructed of loose sticks put negligently together in
a manner similar to the nests of the Yellow-billed Cuckoos. It contained
two large white and nearly spherical eggs.</p>

<p>Dr. Gambel states that these birds devour reptiles as well as other insects,
which is also confirmed by the observations of Mr. Arthur Schott.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Couch mentions that this bird, called Paisano by the Mexicans,
is also held in high estimation by them on account of its enmity to the rattle-snake,
which it usually succeeds in killing in fair combat. Though by
no means deficient in courage, it is represented as remarkably quiet and
harmless in its habits. The only note he heard from it was a weak scream,
which is seldom uttered. It is unsocial, is never seen in flocks, and rarely
wanders from its restricted locality.</p>

<p>In regard to their note, Dr. Cooper mentions hearing one at Fort Mohave
<!--525.png--><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 475]</span>
making a low cooing noise like that of a dove, for which it was at first mistaken.
He afterwards heard it cooing harshly and chattering its mandibles
together, at the same time jerking up its tail and erecting its crest.</p>

<p>Where not molested, Dr. Cooper states that they become quite tame, and
seem to have a preference for towns and houses. At Santa Barbara he
observed one young bird nearly fledged as early as May.</p>

<p>Mr. A. J. Grayson had one of these birds in confinement, which became
quite tame, and readily fed upon any kind of raw meat, but preferred lizards
and small birds, the latter of which it swallowed, feathers and all. If given
to him alive, he would play with them awhile before swallowing them, as a cat
does with a mouse. They are sometimes tamed, and kept about gardens to kill
mice and insects. Dr. Kennerly also states that when taken alive they soon
become quite tame, and willingly remain about a house, soon destroying all
the mice in the vicinity, which they catch with as much dexterity as a cat.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser found this bird abundant throughout the mesquite regions, and
more particularly so near the Rio Grande. He found its eggs near San Antonio
in April and May, and received them even as late as the <abbr title="twenty-third">23d</abbr> of September.
They build a clumsy nest of mesquite twigs, placed at some height
on a bough or in a hollow tree, and lay from two to four pure white eggs.
The stomachs examined by Mr. Dresser were found to contain small snakes,
lizards, and ticks. He had one in a semi-domesticated state at Matamoras,
which became very tame, and was so mischievous that he could not let it
remain in the house. It would steal and hide everything that it could carry
off, and was particularly fond of tearing up letters and upsetting the inkstand.
It was never caged or tied up, and would frequently pay the neighbors a
visit, always returning before evening. He fed it on raw meat and lizards. It
flew with great ease, and was very fond of perching on the house-top. This
bird had a singular antipathy to a tame parrot, and whenever the latter was
let out of the cage, it would get into a rage, and either go to the house-top
or decamp to some of the neighbors.</p>

<p>The eggs are white, of a rounded oval, equal at either end, and measure
1.60 by 1.22 inches.</p>

The American Cuckoos differ from the European (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cuculus</i>) by having
lengthened naked tarsi, instead of very short feathered ones. The nostrils,
too, are elongated instead of rounded. The habits of the two are entirely
different, the American species rearing their own young, instead of laying
the eggs in the nests of other birds, like the European Cuckoo and the
American Cowbird (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Molothrus pecoris</i>).</p>

<p>There is considerable variation in the amount of rufous in the quills;
sometimes this shows very distinctly externally, sometimes it is entirely
replaced by the bronzed olive of the back. A greater amount of the rufous
<!--528.png--><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 478]</span>
seems to characterize the more southern and Jamaica specimens, which also
are smaller; northern specimens, however, show similar variations. In the
immature birds the under surface of the tail-feathers is gray, not black, so
that the contrast with the white tips is very indistinct, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">erythrophthalmus</i>,
in which, however, these light tips are much narrower, while the bill is
entirely black.</p>

<p>Specimens of this bird from regions west of the Missouri, and especially
one from Cantonment Burgwyn, New Mexico, are appreciably larger than
eastern, with decidedly longer bill. One brought from Mazatlan by Mr.
Xantus is undistinguishable from the long-billed western variety.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Yellow-billed Cuckoo is distributed throughout North
America from Canada to Florida, and from the Atlantic coast to California.
It has been met with in all the principal West India Islands.
I have received specimens of its eggs and nest from Southwestern Texas.
Audubon mentions finding this bird high up on the Mississippi River, on
the upper branches of the Arkansas, and in Upper Canada, as well as in
every State between these limits. Mr. Newton found it breeding in the island
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix, Mr. Gosse mentions it as a bird of Jamaica, and Lembeye
gives it among those of Cuba, and Mr. Salvin found it in Central America.
It is known to breed from the West Indies and Florida to Minnesota, and
from New Brunswick to Texas. It does not appear to have been met with
in any of the government expeditions, except by Dr. Woodhouse, who speaks
of it as very common in the Indian Territory, Texas, and New Mexico.</p>

<p>This species was seen on one occasion, and heard at other times, near Sacramento
City, <abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>, by Mr. Ridgway, in June, 1867. It was there rare, or at
least not common, and found principally in the willow-thickets. It was
again met with in July, of the same year, along the Truckee River, in Nevada,
where, also, it appeared to be very rare.</p>

<p>Wilson traced it as far north as Lake Ontario, and speaks of finding it
numerous in the Chickasaw and Choctaw nations, and as breeding in the
upper part of Georgia. He seems to have observed very carefully its habits,
and to have enjoyed favorable opportunities for his observations. His account
of their nesting is interesting. He states that, in marked contrast to
the singularly unparental conduct of their European relatives, the American
Cuckoos build their own nest, hatch their own eggs, and rear their own
young, and that in conjugal and parental affection they seem to be surpassed
by no other birds. He adds that they begin to pair early in May, and commence
building about the 10th of that month. He describes their nest as
usually fixed among the horizontal branches of an apple-tree; sometimes in
a solitary thorn, crab, or cedar, in some retired part of the woods. It is constructed
with little art, and scarcely any concavity, of small sticks and
twigs, intermixed with green weeds and blossoms of the maple. On this
almost flat bed the eggs, usually three or four in number, are placed; these
are of a uniform greenish-blue color, and of a size proportionate to that of
<!--529.png--><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 479]</span>
the bird. While the female is sitting, the male is usually not far distant, and
gives the alarm by his notes when any person is approaching. The female
sits so close that you may almost reach her with your hand, and then precipitates
herself to the ground, feigning lameness to draw you away from the spot,
fluttering, trailing her wings, and tumbling over in the manner of the Woodcock
and other birds. Both parents unite in providing food for the young.
This consists chiefly of caterpillars, particularly such as infest apple-trees.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon speaks of this species as not abundant anywhere, therein
differing from Wilson’s statements, but more in accordance with my own observations.
They are, as a species, pretty generally distributed, but at the
same time their numbers are materially affected by the character of the
locality, as they are chiefly to be met with on low grounds and in damp
places. Mr. Audubon also describes their nest as simple and flat, composed
of a few dry sticks and grass, formed much like that of the Carolina Dove,
and like it fastened to a horizontal branch, often within reach. He subsequently
states that when in Charleston, <abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr>, in the early part of June, 1837,
he was invited by Mr. Rhett to visit his grounds in the vicinity of that city,
for the purpose of viewing a nest of this bird. The following is his account
of it: “A nest, which was placed near the centre of a tree of moderate size,
was reached by a son of the gentleman on whose grounds we were. One of
the old birds, which was sitting upon it, left its situation only when within
a few inches of the climber’s hand, and silently glided off to another tree
close by. Two young Cuckoos, nearly able to fly, scrambled off from their
tenement among the branches of the tree, and were caught. The nest was
taken, and carefully handed to me. It still contained three young Cuckoos,
all of different sizes, the smallest apparently just hatched, the next in size
probably several days old, while the largest, covered with pin-feathers, would
have been able to leave the nest in about a week. There were also in the
nest two eggs, one containing a chick, the other fresh or lately laid. The
two young birds which escaped from the nest clung so firmly to the branches
by their feet, that our attempts to dislodge them were of no avail, and we
were obliged to reach them with the hand. On looking at all these birds,
our surprise was great, as no two of them were of the same size, which
clearly showed that they had been hatched at different periods, and I should
suppose the largest to have been fully three weeks older than any of the
rest. Mr. Rhett assured us that he had observed the same in another nest,
placed in a tree within a few paces of his house. He stated that eleven
young Cuckoos had been successively hatched and reared in it by the same
pair of old birds in one season, and that young birds and eggs were to be
seen in it at the same time for many weeks in succession.”</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall states that the nest of this bird is usually forsaken by the owner
if the eggs are handled before the commencement of incubation. They are
very tenacious and affectionate towards their young, and sit so close as almost
to allow of being taken off by the hand. They then frequently precipitate
<!--530.png--><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 480]</span>
themselves to the ground, fluttering, tumbling, and feigning lameness, in
the manner of many other affectionate and artful birds, to draw the intruder
away from the vicinity of the brood. At such times, the mother also utters
the most uncouth guttural sounds as she runs along the ground. While the
female is engaged in sitting on her charge, the male takes his station at no
great distance, and gives alarm by his notes, on the approach of an intruder.
When the young are hatched, both unite in the labor of providing them with
food. He subsequently states that these birds hatch several broods in a
season, which he inferred from the fact of his meeting with a nest containing
eggs as late as the 28th of August. He also speaks of finding in one
instance an egg of the Cuckoo laid in the nest of a Catbird, and in another
instance (June 15) an egg in the nest of a Robin. Such instances must,
however, be very rare. No other writer mentions any similar instance, and
none have ever fallen under my observations.</p>

<p>Mr. Gosse, in his Birds of Jamaica, describes the Yellow-bill as among
the birds of that island, speaks of it as among the regular visitants in spring,
but makes no mention of its breeding there.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Newton, in his paper on the birds of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix (Ibis, 1859,
p. 149), gives an interesting account of its breeding in that locality. He adds
his testimony to the general credit given to this species for the conjugal
affection they evince. On one occasion, he says, a male having been shot,
and shrieking as it fell, the female instantly flew to the spot, and fluttered
along the ground in the manner that an old hen Partridge or other bird would
do, to lead astray the pursuer of her young. On June 2, 1858, he shot a
female of this species, having an egg in her ovary nearly ready for exclusion;
it was quite soft, but had its proper color. On the 29th of the same month,
while riding, he saw the white terminal spots of a Cuckoo’s tail projecting
from a small nest on a manchineel that overhung the path. It was built
in a very open situation, and the bird, as he rode underneath, was not more
than a yard above his head. She sat with nearly all her neck and breast outside
the nest, which was only just large enough to contain the eggs. She did not
fly off until after he had tied up the pony hard by, and had almost touched her
with his whip. There were three eggs, laid side by side in a row, <em>along</em> which
the bird had been sitting. The nest was at some distance from the stem of
the tree, and placed loosely on the bough. It was a mere platform of small
sticks laid one across another, with a few finer twigs and a little grass as a
lining; so slightly was it put together, that, on attempting to take it from the
tree, it fell to pieces.</p>

<p>No writer besides Mr. Audubon makes any mention of, or appears to have
been aware of, the peculiar habits of these birds in hatching out their successive
depositions of eggs, one by one. In this respect they are eccentric, and
do not always exhibit this trait. While I have repeatedly observed facts
exactly corresponding with those noticed by Mr. Audubon in the garden of
Mr. Rhett, at other times I have found in the opening of the season three or
<!--531.png--><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 481]</span>
four eggs laid before incubation commenced, and all hatched before others
were deposited. Then the parents seemed to depend, in no small degree,
upon the warmth of the bodies of the older offspring to compensate to the
younger for their own neglect, as well as for the exposed and insufficient
warmth of the nest. I have repeatedly found in a nest three young and
two eggs, one of the latter nearly fresh, one with the embryo half developed,
while of the young birds one would be just out of the shell, one half fledged,
and one just ready to fly. My attention was first called to these peculiarities
of hatching as early as 1834, by finding, in Cambridge, in a nest with
three young birds, an egg which, instead of proving to be addled, as I anticipated,
was perfectly fresh, and evidently just laid. Subsequent observations
in successive seasons led to the conviction that both this species and the
Black-billed Cuckoo share in these peculiarities, and that it is a general, but
not a universal practice. These facts were communicated to Mr. Audubon,
but not before his attention had been called to the same thing.</p>

<p>In referring to these peculiarities of the American Cuckoo, Mr. Audubon
finds in them a closely connecting link with the European bird, and Mr.
Darwin, carrying still farther the same idea, finds in them also data for regarding
our birds as only one remove from the vagaries of the European
Cuckoo. At the first glance there may seem to be some plausibility in these
deductions. The mere apology for a nest of our Cuckoos and their alternations
of laying and hatching may, to some extent, be regarded as but one
remove from the total neglect of the European to build any nest, making,
instead, successive depositions in the nests of other birds. But there are
other peculiarities of our Cuckoos to be taken into consideration, totally
variant from the polygamous, unconjugal, and unparental European. Their
devotion to their mates and to their offspring, in which both sexes vie with
each other; their extended breeding-season, varying from one to nearly four
months,&mdash;all these characteristics separate them by a long interval from
their namesakes of the Old World.</p>

<p>If the nests of the Cuckoos are incomplete and insufficient, so are also
those of the most exemplary of parents, the whole tribe of Pigeons, and,
like the latter, our Cuckoos more than atone for such deficiencies by the devoted
fidelity with which they adhere to their post of duty even in the face
of imminent dangers; while, after the first offspring of the season have been
hatched, the warmth of their bodies becomes an additional protection from
the exposure of the bare platform on which they are deposited.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are of an oblong-oval shape, equally obtuse
at either end, and measure 1.30 inches in length by 1.00 in breadth.
They vary considerably in size, their minimum breadth being .90 of an
inch, and the length 1.20 inches. Their color is a uniform light bluish-green,
extremely fugitive, and fading even in the closed drawer of a
cabinet.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Specific Characters"><span class="sc">Sp. Char.</span></abbr>
Lower mandible yellow, except at the tip. Body above olivaceous, strongly
tinged with ashy towards and on the head. Beneath pale yellowish-brown, darkest on
the legs and abdomen, becoming lighter to the bill. An elongated spot of dark plumbeous
behind the eye. Inner edges of the quills and under wing-coverts like the belly. Tail-feathers,
except the central, black, with a sharply defined tip of white for about an inch,
this color not extending along the outer web of the quill. Length about 12.00; wing
about 5.25.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Florida Keys to West Indies. Localities: ? <abbr title="Santa">Sta.</abbr> Cruz (<span class="sc">Newton</span>, Ibis, <abbr title="One">I</abbr>, 150);
Cuba (<abbr title="Cabanis Journal Four"><span class="sc">Cab.</span> J. IV</abbr>, 154; <abbr title="Gundlach Repertorium One"><span class="sc">Gundl.</span> Repert. I</abbr>, 1866, 295); Jamaica (<span class="sc">Gosse</span>, <abbr title="Birds Jamaica">B. Jam.</abbr> 281).</p>

<p>This species is readily distinguishable by its fulvous under parts, dark ear-coverts,
and lack of rufous on inner webs of quills. It has the yellow bill
and dark tail, with broad white tips, of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. americanus</i>, although the white
does not extend along the outer web of the feathers.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Audubon, this species is a regular summer visitor to
Key West and the other Florida keys.</p>

<p>This species is more especially West Indian, occurring in nearly all the
islands. There are some local variations in color (Porto-Rican being much
redder, Bahaman paler), as well as in size, but in a large series from the same
island there will be found such differences as to warrant us in considering
all as one species. In a very large series before us, we cannot see any
tangible difference, although Cabanis and Sclater recognize a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. nesiotes</i> from
the Antillean West Indies, as distinguished from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. seniculus</i> from South
American and the windward West Indies; the former, smaller and paler,
and, according to Cabanis, with the white of tip of tail confined to the inner
web; the latter darker beneath, and larger. These characters I do not find
substantiated, nor have I seen one specimen without white in both webs at
the ends of the tail-feathers.</p>

<p>As the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. minor</i> is the earliest one for at least the South American
race, we retain it in preference to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">seniculus</i>, as although scarcely <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minor</i>
in this genus, it is so compared with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Piaya</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Geococcyx</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Saurothera</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species claims a place in the fauna of North America as a
resident of the Florida keys. This is the only locality positively known as
its habitat within the limits of the territory of the United States. The
only specimen referred to in the ninth volume of the Pacific Railroad Surveys
was supposed to have been obtained in Florida. Mr. Nuttall, who
<!--533.png--><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 483]</span>
was the first to include the Mangrove Cuckoo among North American birds,
speaks of it as an inhabitant chiefly of Cayenne, and as occasionally visiting
the extreme Southern States. Mr. Audubon, who was the first to meet
with the species within the limits of the United States, only obtained specimens
of it in Florida, near Key West. I have seen a specimen which was
given to Mr. John G. Bell as having been procured in Southern Mississippi.
Mr. Gosse obtained specimens of this bird in Jamaica, though he had no
opportunity of observing its domestic economy. In the month of January
the specimens he dissected had eggs in their ovaries as large as duck-shot.
Dr. Gundlach gives it as a Cuban bird, but does not mention it as
one that breeds on that island. The Newtons met with this species in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Croix, but appear to have regarded it as not a summer resident, but only in
the light of a visitant in the winter.</p>

<p>Mr. March, referring without doubt to this species, mentions it as a constant
resident in the island of Jamaica, where it is common in the lowlands
during summer. It is said to breed from March to July, building in the
low branches of trees or in shrubs. The nest is described as a structure
composed of a few dry sticks, so loosely put together that it falls to pieces
on any attempt to remove it. Three, rarely four, eggs are laid, which are
of a glaucous-green color, oval, generally round at both ends, and varying
in size from 1.25 inches by .90 to 1.38 inches by 1 inch.</p>

<p>Of late years no specimens seem to have been obtained in Florida, either
by Maynard or by the many other explorers of the Peninsula; and even
if the earlier notices are correct, we may have to consider it as merely a
straggler from the Bahamas, like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Certhiola bahamensis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crotophaga ani</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phonipara
zena</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vireosylvia barbatula</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon, who was the only one of our naturalists who met with
the nest and eggs, discovered them near Key West. He describes the nest
as slightly constructed of dry twigs, and as almost flat, nearly resembling
that of the Yellow-billed Cuckoo. The eggs are the same in number and
form as those of that species, but are somewhat larger. It is said to raise
two broods in one season, and to feed its young on insects until they are
able to provide for themselves. An old bird, caught on its nest, which Mr.
Audubon saw confined in a cage, refused all food and soon pined itself to
death,&mdash;thus evincing, in his opinion, the great affection these birds have for
their own eggs. An egg in the Smithsonian Institution collection, given me
by Mr. John G. Bell of New York, is said to have been obtained in Mississippi
with the parent bird. Its color has slightly faded, and, except in
its greater comparative breadth, it is not distinguishable from the eggs of
the Yellow-bill.</p>

<p>This species differs from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. americanus</i> in the black bill, and the
absence of black on the tail-feathers, the white tips of which are much
shorter and less abruptly defined. One specimen (5,253) from the Upper
Missouri has a much stronger tinge of yellowish-cinnamon on the inner
webs of the quills than the others. The sexes are quite similar.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Black-billed Cuckoo, so closely allied with the common
species in respect to size, appearance, habits, and all its general characteristics,
is also distributed throughout very nearly the same localities, where,
however, it is usually regarded as a much less abundant bird. It is found
throughout the United States as far west as the Missouri plains. Dr.
Woodhouse met with this bird in his expedition down the Zuni and Colorado
Rivers, but states that he saw but very few, either in Texas or in the
Indian Territory. Lembeye, De la Sagra, and Dr. Gundlach include it as a
visitant, in the winter months, to Cuba. Mr. Audubon met with this
Cuckoo in Louisiana only a few times in the course of his various researches,
and never in any Western State except Ohio. He does not seem
to have been aware that it ever breeds south of North Carolina. From
thence to Maine, and even as far north as the Canadas, Nova Scotia, and
Southern Labrador, he gives as its distribution during the breeding-season.
He also regarded it as much more common in low and wooded ground
on the borders of the sea, where it frequents the edges of woods rather than
their interior, and chiefly on the edges of creeks, and in damp places. Mr.
Nuttall appeared to have regarded it as very nearly as common as the Yellow-bill
throughout the United States, and as extending its migrations as far
north as Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. He states that it is found in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
<!--535.png--><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 485]</span>
Domingo and Guiana, and also, on the authority of Mr. Abbott, that it
breeds in Georgia as early as the 1st of April. Mr. Audubon says it was
never met with by Dr. Bachman in South Carolina. It certainly breeds,
however, as far south, at least, as Georgia, as the nest and eggs of this species
were taken at Varnell Station, in the northwestern part of that State,
by the late Dr. Alexander Gerhardt.</p>

<p>It is not mentioned by either Dr. Gambel or Dr. Heermann as among the
birds of the Pacific Coast, and it does not appear to have been actually
obtained by any of the expeditions to the Pacific beyond the Indian Territory.
Its distribution, therefore, during the breeding-season, would seem to
be from Georgia to Canada, and from Texas to Minnesota, inclusive of all the
intermediate territory. Dr. Newberry frequently saw and heard what he
supposed to have been this species, in the trees bordering Cow Creek, near
Fort Reading, but as he did not secure a specimen, he may have been mistaken.
It has been taken at Devil’s Lake, in Minnesota, and in the Red
River Settlement.</p>

<p>Wilson describes the nest of this bird as generally built in a cedar, much
in the same manner, and of nearly the same materials, as that of the Yellow-bill;
the eggs are smaller than those of that bird, usually four or five in
number, and of a deeper greenish-blue.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon speaks of the nest as built in places similar to those chosen
by the other species, as formed of the same materials, and arranged with quite
as little art. He gives the number of eggs as from four to six, of a greenish-blue,
nearly equal at both ends, but rather smaller than those of the Yellow-bill,
rounder, and of a much deeper tint of green. He gives their measurement
as 1.50 inches in length and .87 of an inch in breadth.</p>

<p>Mr. Nuttall, whose description more nearly corresponds with my own observations,
speaks of this species as usually retiring into the woods to breed,
being less familiar than the former species, and choosing an evergreen bush
or sapling for the site of the nest, which is made of twigs pretty well put
together, but still little more than a concave flooring, and lined with moss
occasionally, and withered catkins of the hickory. The eggs are described
as smaller, and three to five in number, of a bluish-green. The female sits
very close on the nest, admitting a near approach before flying. He also
speaks of this species as being less timorous than the Yellow-billed, and
states that near the nest, with young, he has observed the parent composedly
sit and plume itself for a considerable time without showing any alarm at
his presence.</p>

<p>In all the instances in which I have observed the nest of this species, I
have invariably found it in retired damp places, usually near the edges of
woods, and built, not in trees, after the manner of the Yellow-billed Cuckoo,
but in bushes and in low shrubbery, often not more than two or three feet
from the ground. The nest, without being at all remarkable for its finish,
or the nicety of its arrangement, is much more artistic and elaborate than
<!--536.png--><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 486]</span>
that of the Yellow-bill. It is composed of twigs, roots, fine strips of bark,
and moss, and is sometimes interwoven and partially lined with the soft catkins
of trees and blossoms of plants. The eggs vary from three to six in number,
and are often found to have been deposited, and incubation commenced
on them, at irregular intervals, and to be in various stages of development
in the same nest. I have hardly been able to observe a sufficient number
of their nests to be able to state whether this species carries this irregularity
so far as the Yellow-bill, nor am I aware that it has ever been known to
extend its incubations into so late a period of the season. It is, if anything,
more devoted to its offspring than the Yellow-bill. Both parents are assiduous
in the duties of incubation, and in supplying food to each other and
to their offspring. In one instance, where the female had been shot by a
thoughtless boy, as she flew from the nest, the male bird successfully devoted
himself to the solitary duty of rearing the brood of five. At the time of
the death of the female the nest contained two eggs and three young birds.
The writer was present when the bird was shot, and was unable to interpose
in season to prevent it. Returning to the spot not long afterwards, he found
the widowed male sitting upon the nest, and so unwilling to leave it as
almost to permit himself to be captured by the hand. His fidelity and his
entreaties were not disregarded. His nest, eggs, and young, were left undisturbed;
and, as they were visited from time to time, the young nestlings
were found to thrive under his vigilant care. The eggs were hatched out,
and in time the whole five were reared in safety. This single incident
shows how wide is the interval between these Cuckoos and their European
namesakes.</p>

<p>The egg resembles that of the other, but is more spherical and of a much
darker shade of green. The color is equally fugitive, and even in a <a name="note26" id="note26"></a>closed
cabinet fades so that the eggs of the two species are undistinguishable, except
in size and shape. This egg averages 1.10 inches in length by .90 of
an inch in breadth.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Specific Characters"><span class="sc">Sp. Char.</span></abbr>
Bill at the nostrils nearly twice as high as broad; the nostrils elliptical, a
little oblique, situated in the middle of the lower half of the upper mandible. Gonys
nearly straight. Indications of
faint transverse wrinkles along the
upper portion of the bill, nearly
perpendicular to the culmen. Legs
stout; tarsus longer than middle
toe, with seven broad scutellæ
anteriorly extending round to the
middle of each side; the remaining
or posterior portion of each
side with a series of quadrangular
plates, corresponding nearly to the
anterior ones, the series meeting
behind in a sharp ridge. The
wings reach over the basal third
of the tail. The primary quills are
broad and acute, the fourth longest; the first about equal to the tertials. The tail is
graduated, the outer about an inch and a half shorter than the middle ones.</p>

<p class="small">The color generally is black, with steel-blue reflections above, changing sometimes into
violet; duller beneath. The pointed feathers of the head, neck, and breast, with a bronzy
metallic border, appearing also to some extent on the wing-coverts and upper part of
back. Iris brown. Length, 13.20; wing, 6.00; tail, 8.30; tarsus, 1.48.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
West Indies; South Florida. Accidental near Philadelphia. Localities: <abbr title="Santa">Sta.</abbr>
Cruz (<span class="sc">Newton</span>, Ibis, <abbr title="One">I</abbr>, 148).</p>

<p>As already remarked, we do not find reason to admit more than one
species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Crotophaga</i> in the United States and the West Indies, as in the
great variation in size, and to some extent in shape of bill, there is nothing
constant. The species can hardly be considered more than a straggler in
the United States, although a considerable number of specimens have been
seen or taken within its limits. That in the Smithsonian collection was
killed on the Tortugas; but there is one in the collection of the Philadelphia
Academy, killed near Philadelphia by Mr. John Krider, and presented by
him. Mr. Audubon also possessed a pair said to have been killed near New
Orleans.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species, the common Savanna Blackbird of the West India
Islands, is probably only an accidental visitant of the United States, and
may not strictly belong to the avi-fauna of North America.</p>

<p><!--539.png--><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 489]</span>
It is common throughout the West Indies, and in South America as far south
as Brazil. Gosse states it to be one of the most abundant birds of Jamaica.
In speaking of its breeding habits he mentions that it was universally maintained
by the inhabitants that these birds unite and build in company an
immense nest of basket-work, made by the united labors of the flock. This
is said to be placed on a high tree, where many parents bring forth and educate
a common family. This statement is reiterated by Mr. Hill, who says
that a small flock of about six individuals build but one large and capacious
nest, to which they resort in common, and rear their young together.</p>

<p>In July Mr. Gosse found the nest of one of these birds in a <a name="note29" id="note29"></a><i lang="es" xml:lang="es">guazuma</i>
tree. It was a large mass of interwoven twigs, and was lined with leaves.
There were eight eggs in the nest, and the shells of many others were scattered
beneath the tree.</p>

<p>Mr. Newton found these birds very common in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix. He mentions
meeting with a nest of this species June 17. It was about five feet from
the ground, on a large tamarind-tree. He speaks of it as a rude collection
of sticks and twigs, large and deep, partly filled with dry leaves, among
which were fourteen eggs, and around the margin were stuck upright a few
dead twigs of tamarind. Five days afterwards he went to the nest, where he
found but nine eggs, two of which he took. Three days later he found but
four eggs in the nest, it having been robbed in the interim; but six days
afterwards the number had again been increased to eight. He never found
the eggs covered up as if intentionally done. The nest was evidently common
property. There were generally two or three birds sitting close to or
on it, and up in the tree perhaps four or five more, who would continue
screeching all the time he was there. Mr. Newton adds that when the egg
is fresh the cretaceous deposit on the shell is very soft and easily scored,
but it soon hardens. It is mentioned in De Sagra’s list as one of the common
birds of Cuba.</p>

<p>Mr. J. F. Hamilton, in his interesting paper (Ibis, July, 1871) on the
birds of Brazil, mentions finding this species very common at Santo Paulo.
There was scarcely an open piece of ground where there were but few bushes
that had not its flock of these birds. They were especially fond of marshy
ground. They were also often to be seen running about among a herd of
cattle, picking up the insects disturbed by the animals. They seemed utterly
regardless of danger, and would scarcely do more than flit from one bush
to another, even when the numbers of their flock were being greatly thinned.
When concealed in the long grass, they would allow themselves to be almost
trodden on before rising. The Brazilians seldom molest them, as their flesh
is not good to eat.</p>

<p>This bird is known as the Black Witch in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix,&mdash;a name Mr. Newton
supposes to be due to its peculiar call-note, which sounds like <i class="birdcall">que-yuch</i>. Its
familiar habits and its grotesque appearance make it universally known. It
is a favorite object of attack to the Chickaree Flycatcher, in which encounters
<!--540.png--><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 490]</span>
it is apt to lose its presence of mind, and to be forced to make an ignominious
retreat.</p>

<p>These birds are said to be attracted by collections of cattle and horses,
upon the bodies of which they are often seen to alight, feeding upon the
ticks with which they are infested. They are at once familiar and wary,
permitting a limited acquaintance, but a too near approach sets the whole
flock in motion. It moves in a very peculiar gliding flight. In feeding it
is omnivorous; besides insects of all kinds, such as ticks, grasshoppers, beetles,
etc., it eats berries of various kinds, lizards, and other kinds of food.
It catches insects on the ground by very active jumps, pursues them on the
wing, and with its sharp thin bill digs them out in the earth. They hop
about and over the bodies of cattle, especially when they are lying down,
and when grazing they have been observed clinging to a cow’s tail, picking
insects from it as far down even as its extremity.</p>

<p>Mr. Hill states that these birds are downward, not upward, climbers.
They enter a tree by alighting on the extremity of some main branch, and
reach its centre by creeping along the stem, and seldom penetrate far among
the leaves.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species are of a regularly oval shape, equally obtuse at
either end. In color they are of a uniform light-blue, with a very slight
tinge of green. This is usually covered, but not entirely concealed, by a
white cretaceous coating. When fresh, this may readily be rubbed off, but
becomes hard and not easily removed. The eggs vary in size from 1.40 to
1.50 inches in length, and in breadth from 1.10 to 1.15 inches.</p>

<h2>
<span class="sc">Family</span> <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">PICIDÆ</span>.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Woodpeckers.</span></h2>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Characteristics"><span class="sc">Char.</span></abbr>
Outer toe turned backwards permanently, not versatile laterally, the basal
portion of the tongue capable of great protrusion.</p>

<p>The preceding characters combined appear to express the essential characters
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picidæ</i>. In addition, it may be stated that the tongue itself is
quite small, flat, and short, acute and horny, usually armed along the edges
with recurved hooks. The horns of the hyoid apparatus are generally very
long, and curve round the back of the skull, frequently to the base of the
bill, playing in a sheath, when the tongue is thrown forward out of the
mouth to transfix an insect.</p>

<p>There are twelve tail-feathers, of which the outer is, however, very small
and rudimentary (lying concealed between the outer and adjacent feathers),
so that only ten are usually counted. The tail is nearly even, or cuneate,
never forked, the shafts very rigid in the true Woodpeckers; soft in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picumninæ</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Yunginæ</i>. The outer primary is generally very short, or spurious,
but not wanting. The bill is chisel or wedge shaped, with sharp angles
and ridges and straight culmen; sometimes the culmen is a little curved,
in which case it is smoother, and without the ridges. The tarsi in the North
American forms are covered with large plates anteriorly, posteriorly with
small ones, usually more or less polygonal. The claws are compressed,
much curved, very strong and acute.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picidæ</i> are found all over the world with the exception of Madagascar,
Australia, the Moluccas, and Polynesia. America is well provided with
them, more than half of the described species belonging to the New World.</p>

<p>The subfamilies of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picidæ</i> may be most easily distinguished as follows,
although other characters could readily be given:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="indent1"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picinæ.</b> Tail-feathers pointed, and lanceolate at end; the shafts very
rigid, thickened and elastic.</p>

<p class="indent1"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picumninæ.</b> Tail soft and short, about half the length of wing; the feathers
without stiffened shafts, rather narrow, linear, and rounded at end.</p>

<p class="indent1"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Yunginæ.</b> Tail soft and rather long, about three fourths the length of
wing; the feathers broad, and obtusely rounded at end.</p>

<p>Of these subfamilies the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picinæ</i> alone occur north of Mexico. The
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Yunginæ</i>, to which the well-known Wryneck of England (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jynx torquilla</i>)
belongs, are exclusively Old World; the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picumninæ</i> belong principally to
the tropical regions of America, although a few species occur in Africa and
India. One species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picumnus micromegas</i>, Sundevall, belongs to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Domingo,
although erroneously assigned to Brazil. This is the giant of the
group, being about the size of the White-bellied Nuthatch (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sitta carolinensis</i>)
the other species being mostly very diminutive, varying from three to four
inches in length.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Subfamily</span> <b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><span class="ls">PICINÆ</span></b>.</p>

<p>The diagnosis on the preceding page will serve to distinguish this group
from its allies, without the necessity of going into greater detail. It includes
by far the largest percentage of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picidæ</i>, and in the great variations
of form has been variously subdivided by authors into sections. Professor
Sundevall, in his able monograph,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_124" id="fnanchor_124"></a><a href="#footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></span>
establishes the following four series, referring
all to the single genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus</i>:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="indent1"><abbr title="One">I.</abbr> <b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Angusticolles.</b> Neck slender, elongated. Nostrils concealed by
bristles. Tail-feathers black or brownish, immaculate.</p>

<p class="indent1"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> <b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Securirostres.</b> Neck not slender, and shorter. Nostrils concealed
by bristles. Bill stout, cuneate, with the nasal ridges widely distant
from each other.</p>

<p class="indent1"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> <b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ligonirostres.</b> Neck not slender. Nostrils covered, nasal ridges
of bill placed near the culmen (or at least nearer it than the lower
edge of the upper mandible), for the most part obsolete anteriorly.</p>

<p class="indent1"><abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> <b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nudinares.</b> Nostrils open, uncovered by bristly hairs. Neck and
bill various.</p>

<p>Of these series, the first and second correspond with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Piceæ</i>, as given below,
while <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centureæ</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colapteæ</i> both belong to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ligonirostres</i>. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nudinares</i>
are not represented in North America, and by only one group, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Celeus</i>, in any
portion of the continent.</p>

<p>In the following account of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picinæ</i>, we shall not pretend to discuss
the relationship of the North American species to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picinæ</i> in general,
referring to Sundevall’s work, and the monographs of Malherbe and Cassin,
for information on the subject. For our present purposes they may be conveniently,
even if artificially, arranged in the following sections:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="indent1"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Piceæ.</b> Bill variable in length; the outlines above and below nearly
straight; the ends truncated; a prominent ridge on the side of the
mandible springing from the middle of the base, or a little below, and
running out either on the commissure, or extending parallel to and a
little above it, to the end, sometimes obliterated or confluent with the
lateral bevel of the bill. Nostrils considerably overhung by the lateral
ridge, more or less linear, and concealed by thick bushy tufts of feathers
at the base of the bill. Outer posterior toe generally longer than the
anterior.</p>

<p class="indent1"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centureæ.</b> Bill rather long; the outlines, that of the culmen especially,
decidedly curved. The lateral ridge much nearest the culmen,
and, though quite distinct at the base, disappearing before coming to
the lower edge of the mandible; not overhanging the nostrils, which
are broadly oval, rounded anteriorly, and not concealed by the bristly
feathers at the base. Outer pair of toes nearly equal; the anterior
rather longer.</p>

<p class="indent1"><b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colapteæ.</b> Bill rather long, much depressed, and the upper outline

considerably curved. Bill without any ridges. The nostrils broadly
oval, and much exposed. Anterior outer toe longest.</p>

<p>The preceding diagnoses will serve to distinguish the three groups sufficiently
for our present purposes; the bill being strongest in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picinæ</i> and
best fitted for cutting into trees by its more perfect wedge-shape, with
strengthening ridges, as well as by the lateral bevelling of both mandibles,
which are nearly equal in thickness at the base, and with their outlines
nearly straight. The lateral ridge is prominent, extending to the edge or
end of the bill, and overhangs the nostrils, which are narrow and hidden.
The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centureæ</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colapteæ</i> have the upper mandible more curved
(the commissure likewise), the lower mandible smaller and weaker, the
bill with little or no lateral bevelling. The nostrils are broadly oval and
exposed. In the former, however, there is a distinct lateral ridge visible
for a short distance from the base of the bill; while in the other there
is no ridge at all, and the mandible is greatly curved.</p>

<p>In all the species of North American Woodpeckers, there is more or less
red on the head in the male, and frequently in the female. The eggs of all
are lustrous polished white, without any markings, and laid in hollow trees,
upon a bed of chips, no material being carried in for the construction of the
nest.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="sc">Section</span> <b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">PICEÆ</b>.</p>

<p>With the common characters, as already given, there are several well-marked
generic groups in this section of Woodpeckers which may be arranged
for the United States species as follows:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="comchar"><b class="primary-subset">A.</b> Posterior outer toe longer than the anterior outer one. (Fourth toe longer
than third.)</p>

<p class="indent1"><i class="subset">a.</i> Lateral ridge starting above the middle of the base of the bill, and
extending to the tip.</p>

<p class="indent2">1. <b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Campephilus.</b> Lateral ridge above the middle of the lateral profile
of the bill when opposite the end of the nostrils, which are ovate, and
rounded anteriorly. Bill much depressed, very long; gonys very long.
Posterior outer toe considerably longer than the anterior. Primaries
long, attenuated towards the tip. Spurious quill nearly half the second.
Shafts of four middle tail-feathers remarkably stout, of equal size, and
abruptly very much larger than the others; two middle tail-feathers
narrower towards bases than towards end.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_125" id="fnanchor_125"></a><a href="#footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></span>
A pointed occipital crest.</p>

<p class="indent2">2. <b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus.</b> Lateral ridge in the middle of the lateral profile opposite the
end of the nostrils, which are ovate and sharp-pointed anteriorly. Bill
moderate, nearly as broad as high.</p>

<p class="indent2"><!--546.png--><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 494]</span>
Outer hind toe moderately longer than the outer fore toe. Primaries
broad to the tip, and rounded. Spurious primary not one third the
second quill.</p>

<p class="indent2">3. <b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picoides.</b> Lateral ridge below the middle of the profile, opposite
the end of the ovate acute nostrils, which it greatly overhangs. Bill
greatly depressed; lower mandible deeper than the upper. Inner
hind toe wanting, leaving only three toes. Tufts of nasal bristles very
full and long.</p>

<p class="indent1"><i class="subset">b.</i> Lateral ridge starting below the middle of the base of the bill, and
running as a distinct ridge into the edge of the commissure at about its
middle; the terminal half of the mandible rounded on the sides, although
the truncate tip is distinctly bevelled laterally.</p>

<p class="indent2">4. <b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphyropicus.</b> Nostrils considerably overhung by the lateral ridge,
very small, linear. Gonys as long as the culmen, from the nostrils.
Tips of tail-feathers elongated and linear, not cuneate. Wings very
long; exposed portion of spurious primary about one fourth that of
second quill.</p>

<p class="comchar"><b class="primary-subset">B.</b> Posterior outer toe considerably shorter than the anterior outer one. (Fourth
toe shorter than third).</p>

<p class="indent2">5. <b class="birdname" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hylotomus.</b> Bill depressed. Lateral ridge above the middle of
the lateral profile near the base. Nostrils elliptical, wide, and rounded
anteriorly. Tail almost as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphyropicus</i>. A pointed occipital crest,
as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Campephilus</i>, and not found in the other genera.</p>

<p>The arrangement in the preceding diagnosis is perhaps not perfectly
natural, although sufficiently so for our present purpose. Thus, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hylotomus</i>,
in having the lateral ridge extending to the end of the bill, is like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus</i>,
but the nostrils are broader, more open, and not acute anteriorly. The tail-feathers
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphyropicus</i> differ greatly from those of the others in being
abruptly acuminate, the points elongated, narrow, and nearly linear, instead
of being gently cuneate at the ends. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Campephilus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hylotomus</i> belong
to Sundevall’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Angusticolles</i>, with their long slender neck, and elongated
occipital crest (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dryocopinæ</i>, <abbr title="Cabanis">Cab.</abbr>); the other genera to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Securirostres</i>, with
shorter, thicker neck, and no crest (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dendrocopinæ</i>, <abbr title="Cabanis">Cab.</abbr>). But no two

Bill considerably longer than the head, much depressed, or broader than
high at the base, becoming somewhat compressed near the middle and gradually bevelled
off at the tip. Culmen very slightly curved, gonys as concave, the curve scarcely appreciable;
commissure straight. Culmen with a parallel ridge on each side, starting a
little above the centre of the basal outline of the bill, the ridge projecting outwards and
downwards, and a slight concavity between it and the acute ridge of the culmen. Gonys
considerably more than half the commissure. Nostrils oval below the lateral ridge near
the base of the bill; concealed by the bristly feathers directed forward. Similar feathers
are seen at the sides of the lower jaw and on the chin.</p>

Feet large; outer hind toe much longest; claw of inner fore toe reaching to middle of
outer fore claw; inner hind toe scarcely more than half the outer one; its claw reaching
as far as the base of the inner anterior claw, considerably more than half the outer
anterior toe. Tarsus rather shorter than the inner fore toe. Tail long, cuneate; shafts
of the four middle feathers abruptly much larger than the others, and with a deep groove
running continuously along their under surface; webs of the two middle feathers
deflected, almost against each other, so that the feathers appear narrower at the base
than terminally. Wings long and pointed, the third, fourth, and fifth quills longest;
sixth secondary longest, leaving six “tertials,” instead of three or four as usual; primaries
long, attenuated. Color continuous black, relieved by white patches. Head with a
pointed occipital crest.</p>

half an inch posterior to the commissure, and passing down the sides of the neck, and
extending down each side of the back. Under wing-coverts, and the entire exposed
portion of the secondary quills, with ends of the inner primaries, bristles, and a short
stripe at the base of the bill, white. Crest scarlet, upper surface black. Length, 21.00;

Southern Atlantic and Gulf States. North to North Carolina and mouth of the
Ohio; west to Arkansas and Eastern Texas. Localities: Brazos and Trinity Rivers,
Texas (<span class="sc">Dresser</span>, Ibis, 1865, 468, breeds).</p>

<p>In the male the entire crown (with its elongated feathers) is black. The
scarlet commences just above the middle of the eye, and, passing backwards
a short distance, widens behind and bends down as far as the level of the
under edge of the lower jaw. The feathers which spring from the back of
the head are much elongated above; considerably longer than those of
the crown. In the specimen before us the black feathers of the crest do
not reach as far back as the scarlet.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> So far as we have information in regard to the geographical distribution
of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker, it is chiefly restricted in its range
to the extreme Southern States,
and especially to those bordering
on the Gulf of Mexico. Wilson
states that very few, if any, are
ever found north of Virginia,
and not many even in that State.
His first specimen was obtained
near Wilmington, <abbr title="North Carolina">N. C.</abbr> It is
not migratory, but is a resident
where found.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon, who is more
full than any other writer in his
account of this bird, assigns to it a
more extended distribution. He
states that in descending the
Ohio River he met with it near
the confluence of that river with
the Mississippi, and adds that it
is frequently met with in following
the windings of the latter
river either downwards towards
the sea, or upwards in the direction
of the Missouri. On the Atlantic
he was inclined to make North Carolina the limit of its northern
distribution, though now and then individuals of the species have been
accidentally met with as far north as Maryland. To the westward of the
Mississippi he states that it is found in all the dense forests bordering the
streams which empty into it, from the very declivities of the Rocky Mountains.
The lower parts of the Carolinas, Georgia, North Florida, Alabama,
Louisiana, and Mississippi, are, however, its favorite resorts, and in those
States it constantly resides.</p>

<p>It was observed by Dr. Woodhouse in the timber on the Arkansas River,
and in Eastern Texas, but quite rarely in both places. It was not, however,
met with in any other of the government expeditions, either to the Pacific,
in the survey of the railroad routes, or in that for the survey of the Mexican
boundary line. It is given as a bird of Cuba by De la Sagra, in his catalogue
<!--550.png--><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 498]</span>
of the birds of that island, as observed by him, October, 1850, and by Dr.
John Gundlach, in his list of the birds that breed in Cuba. It is not mentioned
by Gosse among the birds of Jamaica, nor by the Newtons as found
in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix. As it is not a migratory bird, it may be regarded as breeding in
all its localities, except where it is obviously an accidental visitant.</p>

<p>Wilson, who never met with the nest of this Woodpecker, states, on the
authority of reliable informants, that it breeds in the large-timbered cypress
swamps of the Carolinas. In the trunks of these trees at a considerable
height from the ground, both parents working alternately, these birds dig out
a large and capacious cavity for their eggs and young. Trees thus dug out
have frequently been cut down with both the eggs and the young in them.
The hole was described to Wilson as generally a little winding, to keep out
the rain, and sometimes five feet deep. The eggs were said to be generally
four, sometimes five in number, as large as pullets’, pure white, and equally
thick at both ends. The young make their appearance about the middle or
end of June.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon, whose account of the breeding-habits of the Ivory-bill is
given from his own immediate observations, supplies a more minute and detailed
history of its nesting. He states that it breeds earlier in spring than
any other species of its tribe, and that he has observed it boring a hole for
that purpose as early as the beginning of March. This hole he believed to
be always made in the trunk of a live tree, generally an ash or a hackberry,
and at a great height. It pays great regard to the particular situation of the
tree and the inclination of the trunk, both with a view to retirement and to
secure the aperture against rains. To prevent the latter injury, the hole is
generally dug immediately under the protection of a large branch. It is
first bored horizontally a few inches, then directly downward, and not in a
spiral direction, as Wilson was informed. This cavity is sometimes not
more than ten inches in depth, while at other times it reaches nearly three
feet downward into the heart of the tree. The older the bird, the deeper its
hole, in the opinion of Mr. Audubon. The average diameter of the different
nests which Mr. Audubon examined was about seven inches in the inner
parts, although the entrance is only just large enough to admit the bird.
Both birds work most assiduously in making these excavations. Mr. Audubon
states that in two instances where the Woodpeckers saw him watching
them at their labors, while they were digging their nests, they abandoned
them. For the first brood, he states, there are generally six eggs. These are
deposited on a few chips at the bottom of the hole, and are of a pure white
color. The young may be seen creeping out of their holes about a fortnight
before they venture to fly to any other tree. The second brood makes its
appearance about the 15th of August. In Kentucky and Indiana the Ivory-bill
seldom raises more than one brood in a season. Its flight is described
by Audubon as graceful in the extreme, though seldom prolonged to more
than a few hundred yards at a time, except when it has occasion to cross a
<!--551.png--><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 499]</span>
large river. It then flies in deep undulations, opening its wings at first to
their full extent, and nearly closing them to renew their impulse. The
transit from tree to tree is performed by a single sweep, as if the bird had
been swung in a curved line from the one to the other.</p>

<p>Except during the love-season it never utters a sound when on the wing.
On alighting, or when, in ascending a tree, it leaps against the upper parts
of the trunk, its remarkable voice may be constantly heard in a clear, loud,
and rather plaintive tone, sometimes to the distance of half a mile, and
resembling the false high note of a clarionet. This may be represented by
the monosyllable <i class="birdcall">pait</i> thrice repeated.</p>

<p>The food of this Woodpecker consists principally of beetles, larvæ, and
large grubs. They are also especially fond of ripe wild grapes, which they
eat with great avidity, hanging by their claws to the vines, often in the
position of a Titmouse. They also eat ripe persimmons, hackberries, and
other fruit, but are not known to disturb standing corn nor the fruits of the
orchard.</p>

<p>These birds attack decaying trees so energetically as often to cause them
to fall. So great is their strength, that Audubon has known one of them
to detach, at a single blow, a strip of bark eight inches long, and, by beginning
at the top branch of a dead tree, tear off the bark to the extent of
thirty feet in the course of a few hours, all the while sounding its loud
notes.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon further states that this species generally moves in pairs, that
the female is the least shy and the most clamorous, and that, except when
digging a hole for the reception of their eggs, they are not known to
excavate living trees, but only those attacked by worms. When wounded,
they seek the nearest tree, and ascend with great rapidity by successive hops.
When taken by the hand, they strike with great violence, and inflict severe
wounds with their bills and claws.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser states that these birds were found on the Brazos River, and
also on the Trinity, where they were by no means rare.</p>

<p>Wilson dwells at some length and with great force upon the great value
of these birds to our forests. They never injure sound trees, only those
diseased and infested with insects. The pine timber of the Southern States
is often destroyed, thousands of acres in a season, by the larvæ of certain insects.
In Wilson’s day this was noticeable in the vicinity of Georgetown,
<abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr>, and was attributed by him to the blind destruction of this and other
insect-eating birds.</p>

<p>An egg of this species (<abbr title="Smithsonian Collection, Number">Smith. Coll., No.</abbr> 16,196) taken near Wilmington,
<abbr title="North Carolina">N. C.</abbr>, by Mr. N. Giles, measures 1.35 inches in length by .95 of an
inch in breadth. It is of a highly polished porcelain whiteness, and is much
more oblong in shape and more pointed than are the eggs of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hylotomus
pileatus</i>.</p>

<p>The small black and white Woodpeckers of North America exhibit great
variations in size and markings, and it
is extremely difficult to say what is a
distinct species and what a mere geographical
race. In none of our birds is
the difference in size between specimens
from a high and a low latitude so great,
and numerous nominal species have been
established on this ground alone. There
is also much variation with locality in
the amount of white spotting on the
wings, as well as the comparative width
of the white and black bars in the banded
species. The under parts, too, vary from
pure white to smoky-brown. To these
variations in what may be considered as
good species is to be added the further perplexities caused by hybridism,
which seems to prevail to an unusual extent among some Woodpeckers,
where the area of distribution of one species is overlapped by a close ally.
This, which can be most satisfactorily demonstrated in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colaptes</i>, is also

probably the case in the black and white species, and renders the final settlement
of the questions involved very difficult.</p>

<p>After a careful consideration of the subject, we are not inclined to admit
any species or permanent varieties of the group of four-toed small white
and black Woodpeckers as North or Middle American, other than those mentioned
in the preceding synopsis.</p>

North America, to the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains, and (<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">canadensis</i>)
along the 49th parallel to British Columbia; Sitka; accidental in England.</p>

<p>In the infinite variation shown by a large number of specimens in the
markings of the wings, so relied on by authors to distinguish the species of
the black and white spotted North American Woodpeckers having a longitudinal
band of white down the back, it will be perhaps our best plan to cut
them rigorously down to two, the old-fashioned and time-honored <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. villosus</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pubescens</i>; since the larger and more perfect the series, the more difficult
it is to draw the line between them and their more western representatives.
The size varies very greatly, and no two are alike in regard to the
extent and number of the white spots. Beginning at one end of the chain,
we find the white to predominate in the more eastern specimens. Thus in
one (20,601) from Canada, and generally from the north, every wing-covert
(except the smallest) and every quill shows externally conspicuous spots or
bands of white; the middle coverts a terminal band and central spot; the
greater coverts two bands on the outer web, and one more basal on the inner;
and every quill is marked with a succession of spots in pairs throughout its
length,&mdash;the outer web as bands reaching nearly to the shaft; the inner
as more circular, larger spots. The alula alone is unspotted. This is the
typical marking of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. leucomelas</i> or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">canadensis</i> of authors. The white
markings are all larger respectively than in other forms.</p>

<p>The next stage is seen in typical or average <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. villosus</i> for the Middle
States. Here the markings are much the same, but the white is more restricted,
and on the outer webs of the feathers forms rounded spots rather
than bands. Some Carlisle specimens have two spots on the middle coverts
as described, others lack the basal one. Another stage is exhibited by a specimen
from Illinois, in which with two spots on the middle coverts there is but
one terminal on the outer web of the greater, and a reduction in number
of spots on the inner webs of innermost secondaries, terminal outer spots
not having the corresponding inner. This form is quite prevalent westward
and on the Upper Missouri, but cannot be considered as strictly geographical,
since a Massachusetts and a Georgia skin agree in the same characters.</p>

<p>In all this variation there is little diminution in the number of spots
visible externally, nor so far have we seen any from the region east of the
Missouri plains that lack white spots on every covert (except the smallest
ones) and every quill, and with few exceptions on both webs of the latter.
It is therefore this style that we propose to consider as pure <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. villosus</i>,
irrespective of variations in the size or shape of the spots, of the amount of
white on tail and back, or of the bird itself. Any deviation from this may be
called a variety. It has the distribution already mentioned, and extends along
the Upper Missouri to British Columbia and Sitka, straggling into Washington
Territory, where, however, it is found with the more typical western form,
<!--559.png--><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 505]</span>
<abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">harrisi</i>. A specimen collected by Mr. Hepburn at Caribou, on the Upper
Fraser, is absolutely undistinguishable from typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. canadensis</i> in size
and markings.</p>

<p>We now come to the western race or variety, hardly to be called species,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. harrisi</i> of Audubon. Here the extreme of condition most opposed to
typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">villosus</i> is shown by the entire absence of white on the exposed surface
of the wing, except on the outer webs of the four or five longest primaries,
where the spots are very small. (We have never seen them entirely
wanting.) The white of the back, too, may be normal in amount, or else
much restricted. Concealed white spots on some of the feathers will be
seen on raising them. The white of tail-feathers sometimes shows black
spots or blotches, especially on the inner web of the second. These features
belong more especially to specimens from the coast region of Oregon and
Washington.</p>

<p>Proceeding eastward from the Northern Pacific Coast we next find specimens
showing a few white streaks on the greater coverts and next on the
middle coverts. The spots on the secondaries, too, begin to show themselves;
but as a general rule they do not occur on the innermost of the greater
coverts and of the secondaries. This, therefore, may be considered as the
limit of a variety, characterized by the absence at least of spots in these
members of the wing.</p>

<p>With the variation in spots in the western variety we have, as already
remarked, differences in amount of white on the tail and the back, as well as
in the color of the belly, which is sometimes pure white, sometimes of a
smoky gray; this latter variation not at all parallel with other differences or
with geographical distribution, and equally observable in eastern <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">villosus</i>.
The size, too, varies somewhat, but not to the same extent as on the Atlantic
side. Here, however, we have <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus jardini</i> of Mexico and Central America,
as the small southern race, absolutely undistinguishable from dark-breasted
Oregon specimens, except in size (length, 7.00; wing, 3.90; bill above, .85),
and perhaps a more fulvous tinge on the under parts. The specimens before
me have one or two black spots on the inner web of the next to the outer
tail-feather, as in darker varieties of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">harrisi</i>, but these are not symmetrical
or constant in either, and are to be looked on as mere indications of the
general tendency to melanism.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This common and familiar species of Woodpecker has an extended
range throughout eastern North America. Specimens in the Smithsonian
Institution have been collected from almost every portion of North
America east of the Rocky Mountains. Wilson speaks of it as common
throughout the continent from Hudson’s Bay to Carolina and Georgia. Mr.
Audubon, who regarded <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus martinæ</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. phillipsi</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. canadensis</i> as distinct
species, instead of varieties of this Woodpecker, states, in regard to its distribution,
that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. villosus</i> is a constant resident both in the maritime and
inland districts from Texas to New Hampshire, as well as in all the wooded
<!--560.png--><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 506]</span>
tracts intervening between the junction of the Missouri and Mississippi, and
the northern borders of the great lake. He adds that not an individual was
found by him or by his sons in Maine, where he did, however, obtain in great
abundance the variety he called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. canadensis</i>. According to Sir John Richardson
it is found as far to the north as the <abbr title="sixty-third">63d</abbr> parallel. It remains all the
year round in the fur countries, and is the most common species up to the
fifty-sixth degree of latitude, north of which it yields in frequency to the
three-toed species. Dr. Woodhouse speaks of it as common in Texas and
in the Indian Territory. Although not crossing the Rocky Mountains in
the United States, it reaches the Pacific Coast of British Columbia, and is
found north as far as Sitka, and perhaps still farther, thus replacing the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">harrisi</i>. It is a resident, and not a migratory, species, and wherever found
it also breeds. Several specimens have been killed in England.</p>

<p>According to the observations of Wilson, this Woodpecker frequents the
orchards and cultivated grounds, and is less wild and more domestic than
most of the species. In May, with its mate, it seeks the retirement of the
woods to breed, selecting a branch already hollowed, or excavating one for
itself. In the former case the nest has been known to be four or five feet
from the opening. When it excavates its own opening, it digs horizontally
six or eight inches into the body of the tree, and then downward
to about twice that distance, carrying up the chips in the bill or scraping
them out with the feet. They not unfrequently breed in orchards,
and have been even known to excavate their holes in the rails of old
fences. The female lays five white eggs, which are usually hatched out
early in June.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon observed these birds, at all seasons, in almost every possible
locality, from the isolated trees of large towns and cities, even to the very
midst of the salt marshes about the mouth of the Mississippi. He found
the excavation for the nest more frequently running obliquely than perpendicularly.
In the Southern States they rear two broods in a season, the first
appearing the last of May, the second usually about the first of August. In
the middle and northern districts they rarely raise more than one. Those
which Mr. Audubon observed to raise more than one brood in a season made
use of the same excavation for both, and not unfrequently within a few yards
of a house. The eggs of the first brood he found usually six in number, and
of the second four. Where they have but one brood, the number varies from
four to six, and in two instances he has found seven. The measure given by
him is one inch in length by .69 of an inch in breadth. They are elliptical
or almost equally rounded at both ends, smooth, pure white, and translucent.
The young remain in the nest until well able to fly.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon states that the Hairy Woodpecker becomes, during the winter
months, a very common bird in all parts of the Southern States, coming
to the farm-yards with the downy species to glean the grains of corn left by
the cattle. At this season their visits to the corn-cribs are extremely frequent.
<!--561.png--><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 507]</span>
They may also be seen clinging to the stalks of the sugar-cane, boring
them, and evidently enjoying the sweet juices of that plant.</p>

<p>Their flight is short and rapid, resembling that of other allied species.
They are not social, never more than the members of one family being seen
together. They feed chiefly on insects and their larvæ, often seizing the
former on the wing. In the autumn they occasionally eat berries, seeds,
and small fruit. Their notes are sharp and loud, uttered in monosyllables,
at times with great frequency.</p>

<p>An egg of this species, taken in Roxbury, <abbr title="Massachusetts">Mass.</abbr>, is of a pure crystal whiteness,
oblong in shape, and equally rounded at either end, measuring 1.01
inches in length by .72 of an inch in breadth. Another, from Georgia, is
more rounded at one end, and measures 1.02 inches in length and .75 of an
inch in breadth.</p>

Whole of Western United States, west of the Missouri plains, extending into
Mexico and Central America, where it passes into the smallest and darkest southern extreme,
known as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. jardini</i>. Localities: West Arizona (<span class="sc">Coues</span>, <abbr title="Proceedings Academy of Natural Sciences">P. A. N. S.</abbr> 1866, 52);
Vera Cruz, Alpine regions (<span class="sc">Sumichrast</span>, <abbr title="Memoires Boston Society One">M. Bost. Soc. I</abbr>, 1869, 562).</p>

<p>In the preceding article we have given some general remarks on Harris’s
Woodpecker, and shown why we cannot consider it a well-defined species.
If the specimens from the extreme west were constant in themselves, and the
variations, as with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colaptes hybridus</i>, occurred along the line of contact with
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">villosus</i>, we might refer to hybrids many of the intermediate forms; but as
scarcely any two are alike, even on the Pacific coast, such a view is inadmissible.
As, however, in the extreme limits of variation, there is yet a
<!--562.png--><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 508]</span>
difference from eastern specimens, and this is characteristic of a large area
of country, it may be proper to recognize the form by the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">harrisi</i>.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. jardini</i> appears to be nothing more than the most southern race
of this dark western form of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. villosus</i>, and shows the smallest, as well as
the darkest, extreme to which the species attains. In Southern Mexico
typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. harrisi</i> and this form grade insensibly together. The minimum
of size and maximum darkness of colors are reached in Costa Rica.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This variety was first described by Mr. Audubon from specimens
obtained by Mr. Townsend on the Columbia River. No information was
obtained in regard to its habits, which, it may be presumed, do not vary very
essentially from those of the more familiar <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pubescens</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">villosus</i>. In regard
to its geographical distribution, it has been found in more or less abundance
from Nebraska to the Pacific, and from Mexico to British America. It is
known to occur in Texas on the Rio Grande, in New Mexico, in Arizona,
Nebraska, California, Oregon, and Washington Territory.</p>

<p>This indicates a very general distribution throughout Western North
America from the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, and
from New Mexico and Texas probably to the limits of the forests in the
northwest. It seems to take the place of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. villosus</i> in the far west. Dr.
Heermann, in his notes on the birds of California (Journal of Philadelphia
Academy, <abbr title="Two">II</abbr>, 270), says it is not a common bird, although it is occasionally
met with in that State. Dr. Gambel, however, states that it occupies, on the
western coast, the same place that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. villosus</i> does on the Atlantic, but
seems to have a greater partiality for the pine woods. Dr. Woodhouse did
not meet with it in the expedition to the Zuñi and Colorado. Dr. Newberry
speaks of it (U. S. <abbr title="Pacific Boundary Report Survey Six">P. B. R. Survey, VI</abbr>,&mdash;Zoölogy, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 89) as not uncommon
in the wooded districts of Northern California and Oregon. Dr. Kennerly,
in his report on the birds obtained by Lieutenant Whipple’s party, states
that Harris’s Woodpecker was found along the Little Colorado River in the
month of December, wherever the cottonwood trees grew (U. S. <abbr title="Pacific Railroad Routes">P. R. R.</abbr>
Survey, <abbr title="Ten, Part Six">X, Pt. VI</abbr>, 21). It is not mentioned by Dr. Heermann in his Report
on the birds of Lieutenant Parke’s explorations near the <abbr title="thirty-second">32d.</abbr> parallel. The
same writer, in his Report on the birds of Lieutenant Williamson’s party,
speaks of this bird as having been occasionally observed during the survey,
but as a somewhat rare species, though procured in Northern California and
at Tejon Pass. Dr. Suckley speaks of it as quite abundant at Fort Dalles,
where he found it among the true pines, and at Fort Steilacoom, among the
firs (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">D. douglasi</i>), and as a winter resident in both localities (Natural History
of Washington Territory, Zoölogy, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 159). Dr. Cooper states that
Harris’s Woodpecker is the most abundant species in Washington Territory,
being found on both sides of the Cascade Mountains, frequenting the lower
parts of the great coniferous trees. He found it a constant resident in May,
burrowing out a nest in a dead tree, sometimes only four feet from the
ground. He describes its cries and habits as so exactly like those of the
<!--563.png--><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 509]</span>
larger Sapsucker (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. villosus</i>) of the Atlantic States, that, were there not
constant and unchangeable differences in plumage, it would be taken for
the same species. He furnishes no description of the eggs, but it is quite
probable that there is no appreciable difference between them and those of
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus villosus</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues mentions this species as one of the most common and characteristic
birds in the vicinity of Fort Whipple. Dr. Heermann speaks of its having clear
trumpet-like notes that betray its locality and render it an easy bird to shoot.</p>

<p>In California Dr. Cooper found this chiefly a northern bird, frequenting
the forests of all kinds up to the summits of the Sierra Nevada, and also
resident as far south as Santa Barbara, descending, in winter, to the eastern
branches of the Colorado and to Tejon Pass. He found it more common
in the higher Coast Range near Santa Cruz, and still more so toward the
Columbia River. Its cry, he adds, is louder than that of most of the small
Woodpeckers, and it is rather shy, especially when it imagines itself pursued.
It feeds at times on fruits and berries, and sometimes it visits gardens.
It is known as one of the “Sapsuckers,” but does more good than harm in
the orchard, destroying both insects and their larvæ.</p>

<p>Mr. John K. Lord states that this Woodpecker is by far the most abundant
species in the district through which his party passed. He found it on Vancouver’s
Island, and along the entire course of the boundary-line, south through
Oregon and California, and north to Fort Simpson. A few remained at Colville
during the winter, but the greater number retired to the coast and returned in
April and May. In the latter month they mate, and bore out a hole in a dead
tree. They use no lining for the nest, but lay the eggs on the bare wood. Their
favorite haunts are the stumps of trees growing round swamps or prairie-land.</p>

<p>This Woodpecker was met with by Mr. Ridgway in all wooded portions
of the Great Basin, but was most abundant among the pines on the mountains.
In all respects, it is a perfect counterpart of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. villosus</i> of the
east.</p>

Eastern United States, towards the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains, into
British Columbia and the Humboldt Mountains, and north to the limits of the woods;
along whole Yukon River; perhaps to the Pacific, north of the 49th parallel; Kodiak.
Localities: San Antonio, Texas (<span class="sc">Dresser</span>, Ibis, 1865, 468). Accidental in England.</p>

<p>The remarks already made on the variation of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus villosus</i> apply equally
well here; all the differences in size and markings with locality being almost
exactly reproduced. The western variety, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. gairdneri</i>, is equally uncertain
in characters as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. harrisi</i>, and as little entitled to specific distinction. As
in the previous instance, we shall call typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pubescens</i> those specimens in
which all the middle and greater coverts and all the quills including the
innermost secondaries are spotted with white, while those in which any of
these feathers, whether all the coverts, as in Oregon birds, or only a few of
them, are unspotted, may be called <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gairdneri</i>.</p>

<p>Of typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pubescens</i> in the Eastern States there are minor variations, but
not of much account. Thus the forehead itself, apart from the white nasal
tufts, is sometimes white, connecting with the white superciliary stripe;
more frequently, however, the whole forehead is black. Northern specimens
are larger and have larger white spots, and not unfrequently the black cheek-stripe
is invaded anteriorly by white, which, however, is appreciable at the
base of the feathers. The black bars on the tail are much restricted in
specimens from the Yukon. Southern specimens are smaller and darker,
with smaller spots on the wings.</p>

<p>In all the changes of the two species, there is no difficulty in distinguishing
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. pubescens</i> from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. villosus</i> by the black bars on outer tail-feathers of
the former, and their absence in the latter. The crissum of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pubescens</i> is sometimes
somewhat spotted with blackish. The white markings on the coverts
are larger in proportion, and there are almost always two series of white
spots on the greater coverts, as in northern varieties of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">villosus</i>, not one, as
in most of those from the Middle States.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species, like the Hairy Woodpecker, is a resident rather
than a migratory species, and breeds wherever it is met with. It also seems
to have very nearly the same geographical distribution with that species. Dr.
Woodhouse found it common throughout the Indian Territory, Texas, and
New Mexico. It does not, however, appear to have been collected by any
of the parties engaged in the Pacific Railroad surveys, nor by that upon
the survey of the Mexican boundary. Of seventeen specimens given by
<!--565.png--><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 511]</span>
Professor Baird in 1858 as in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution,
six are from Pennsylvania, two from Massachusetts, two from Missouri,
one from Bonhomme Island in Nebraska, and the rest from Fort Leavenworth,
Salt Creek, Fort Riley, and Platte River in Kansas. It is quite
common throughout the coast region of Alaska, exclusive of the Aleutians,
and throughout the entire valley of the Yukon. Wilson makes no mention
of its geographical distribution, probably because he found it everywhere
common, to the extent of his own investigations. Audubon speaks of it as
very generally distributed from the lower parts of Louisiana to Labrador,
and as far westward as he travelled.</p>

<p>Sir John Richardson states that this species is a constant inhabitant of the
fur countries up to the 58th parallel. It seeks its food principally on the
maple, elm, and ash, and, north of latitude 54<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, where these trees are not
found, on the aspen and birch.</p>

<p>According to Wilson, these birds select a suitable place for the excavation
of their nest, about the middle of May. An apple, pear, or cherry tree, often
in the near neighborhood of a farm-house, is generally fixed upon for this
purpose. The work of excavation is begun by the male, who cuts a hole in the
solid wood as circular as if described with a pair of compasses. He is occasionally
relieved by the female, both parties working with the most indefatigable
diligence. The direction of the hole, when made in the body of
the tree, is downward by an angle of forty degrees for the distance of six or
eight inches, and then directly downward for ten or twelve more. Within,
the excavation is roomy, capacious, and as smooth as if polished by the hand
of the most finished workman. The entrance is, however, left only just
large enough to admit the bodies of the birds. During their labor they even
take the pains to carry their chips to a distance, to prevent suspicion.
This operation sometimes occupies the chief part of a week. The eggs are
generally six in number, pure white, and laid on the smooth bottom of the
cavity. The male supplies the female with food while she is sitting. The
young generally leave the nest about the last of June.</p>

<p>The same writer also gives an interesting account of the impudent coolness
of the House Wren, who, coveting the well-built home of this Woodpecker, and
unable to excavate such an apartment for itself, waits until the poor Woodpeckers
have completed their work, and then attacks them with violence and
drives them off from the nest they have been at so much pains to prepare. He
states that he saw a striking example of this, where the Woodpeckers, after
commencing in a cherry-tree, within a few yards of the house, and having
made considerable progress, were turned out by the Wren. They began again
on a pear-tree in the garden, a few yards off, when, after digging out a most
complete apartment, and laying one egg, they were once more assaulted by
the same impertinent intruder, and finally forced to abandon the place.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon gives substantially the same account of their nesting, only
he assigns an earlier period, the middle of April, for its commencement, and
<!--566.png--><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 512]</span>
describes the entrance to the excavation as often being at right angles to the
trunk for a few inches before it descends. He states that in the Southern
and Middle States two broods are raised in a season, farther north seldom
more than one.</p>

<p>Mr. C. S. Paine, of Randolph, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, speaks of this Woodpecker as being one
of the most common and familiar, in Vermont, of the family. They are to be
met with in his neighborhood at all seasons of the year, though he is of the
opinion that many of them go south to spend the winter. They deposit their
eggs about the first of June in the very snug little excavations they prepare.
The male bird will sometimes prepare a separate apartment for himself, apart
from his mate. Mr. Paine has taken the male in such a hole by himself, and
without any nest or eggs, evidently only prepared for shelter.</p>

<p>This Woodpecker has a single note or cry, sounding like <i class="birdcall">chink</i>, which it
frequently repeats. When it flies, and often when it alights, this cry is
more shrill and prolonged. They are very industrious, and are constantly
employed in search of insects, chiefly in orchards and the more open
groves. The orchard is its favorite resort, and it is particularly fond of boring
the bark of apple-trees for insects. This fact, and the erroneous impression
that it taps the trees for the sap, has given to these birds the common
name of Sapsuckers, and has caused an unjust prejudice against them.
So far from doing any injury to the trees, they are of great and unmixed
benefit. Wilson, who was at great pains to investigate the matter, declares
that he invariably found that those trees that were thus marked by the
Woodpecker were uniformly the most thriving and the most productive.
“Here, then,” adds Wilson, “is a whole species&mdash;I may say genus&mdash;of
birds, which Providence seems to have formed for the protection of our fruit
and forest trees from the ravages of vermin, which every day destroy millions
of those noxious insects that would otherwise blast the hopes of the
husbandman, and even promote the fertility of the tree, and in return
are proscribed by those who ought to have been their protectors.”</p>

<p>The egg of this species is nearly spherical, pure white, and measures .83 by
.72 of an inch.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Specific Characters"><span class="sc">Sp. Char.</span></abbr>
Similar to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pubescens</i> in size and markings, but with less white on the wings.
Varies from entire absence of exposed white spots on the middle and greater wing-coverts
and innermost secondaries, with small spots on the quills, to spots on most of their
feathers, but absent on some, and the spots generally larger.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Pacific coast of United States to Rocky Mountains. Darkest and with least
white in Western Oregon and Washington.</p>

<p>In the preceding article we have given the comparative characters of this
form, which we can only consider as a variety, and not very permanent or
strongly marked at that.</p>

<p>As in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pubescens</i>, this race varies much in the color of the under parts,
which are sometimes pure white, sometimes smoky-brown. It is suggested
that this is partly due to a soiling derived from inhabiting charred trees.
It is, at any rate, of no specific value.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Gairdner’s Woodpecker is the western representative and counterpart
of the Downy Woodpecker of the east, resembling it in size and
general habits, and only differing from it in certain exceptional characteristics
already mentioned. It is found throughout western North America,
probably from Mexico to the British Possessions, and from the eastern base
of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper met with it in California, chiefly in the northern parts of the
State, but did not observe any south of the Santa Clara Valley. Dr. Coues
saw none in Arizona, or possibly a single specimen not positively ascertained.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found one of its nests near Santa Clara, on the 24th of May,
containing young. It had been burrowed in a small and partly rotten tree,
and was about five feet from the ground. From the fact that they were
found breeding so far south he infers that among the mountains they probably
occur much farther to the south, as do most other northern birds. He
found them frequenting chiefly the smaller trees in the vicinity of the evergreen
woods, where they were to be seen at all seasons industriously tapping
the bark to obtain insects.</p>

<p>Dr. Newberry mentions finding them very common in Oregon, and also
in Northern California. In Washington Territory, Dr. Suckley found them
extremely common on the Lower Columbia, especially among the willow-trees
lining its banks. They were resident throughout the winter, and in these
situations were very abundant. In January, 1856, he found them so abundant
among the willows growing on the islands in the delta of the Willamette,
that he readily obtained eight specimens in the space of an hour. At
that season they were very unwary, giving little heed to the presence of man,
not even allowing the near discharge of a gun to interfere with their busy
search for food.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann speaks of it as neither common nor especially rare. He
obtained several specimens among the mountains of Northern California.</p>

<p>Mr. Lord met with these Woodpeckers abundantly in the Northwestern
<!--568.png--><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 514]</span>
Boundary Survey. They differed slightly in their habits from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. harrisi</i>,
generally hunting for insects on the maples, alders, and stunted oaks, rather
than on the pine-trees. Specimens were taken on Vancouver Island, Sumass
Prairie, Colville, and the west slope of the Rocky Mountains at an altitude
of seven thousand feet above the sea-level.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway found this Woodpecker to be unaccountably rare in the
Sierra Nevada and all portions of the Great Basin, as well as in the Wahsatch
and Uintah Mountains, even in places where the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. harrisi</i> was at all
times abundant. Indeed, he only met with it on two or three occasions, in
the fall: first in the Upper Humboldt Valley, in September, where it was
rare in the thickets along the streams; and again in the Wahsatch Mountains,
where but a single brood of young was met with in August.</p>

<p>An egg of this species from Oregon, obtained by Mr. Ricksecker, is larger
than that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pubescens</i>, but similar in shape, being very nearly spherical.
It measures .96 of an inch in length by .85 in breadth.</p>

<p>In the above diagnosis we have endeavored to express the average of
characters belonging to a Woodpecker to which many names, based on
trifling geographical variations, have been assigned, but which legitimately
can be only considered as one species. This is among the smallest of the
North American Woodpeckers, and in all its variations the wings are long,
reaching as far as the short feathers of the tail. The upper parts generally
are black, on the back, rump, and exposed feathers of the wings banded
transversely with white, the black bands rather the narrower; the quills and
larger coverts spotted with the same on both webs, becoming bands on the
innermost secondaries. The upper tail-coverts and two inner tail-feathers
on either side are black. The white bands of the back extend all the way
up to the neck, without any interscapular interruption. The under parts
are of a pale smoky brownish-white, almost with a lilac tinge; on the sides
of the breast and belly are a few scattered small but elongated spots. The
posterior parts of the sides under the wing and the under tail-coverts are
obscurely banded transversely with black. The top of the head, extending
from a narrow sooty frontlet at the base of the bill to a short, broad nuchal
crest, is crimson in the male, each feather with a white spot between the
<!--570.png--><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 516]</span>
crimson and the dark brown base of the feathers. The brown nasal tuft is
scarcely different from the feathers of the forehead.</p>

<p>In a large series of specimens of this species, from a wide area of distribution,
considerable differences are appreciable in size, but fewer in coloration than
might be expected. Yucatan birds are the least (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus parvus</i>, Cabot; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vagatus</i>,
Cassin), the wing measuring 3.30 inches. Those from Southern Mexico
are but little larger (wing, 3.60). In Northern Mexico the wing is nearly
4 inches; in New Mexico it is 4.30. The markings vary but little. The black
and white bands on the back are about of equal width, but sometimes one,
sometimes the other, appears the larger; the more eastern have, perhaps, the
most white. The pattern on the tail is quite constant. Thus, assuming the
three outer feathers to be white, banded with black, the outermost may be
said to have seven transverse bars of black, of which the terminal four
(sometimes five) are distinct and perfect, the basal three (or two) confluent
into one on the inner web (the extreme base of the feather white). The
next feather has, perhaps, the same number of dark bands, but here only
two (sometimes three) are continuous and complete; the innermost united
together, the outer showing as scallops. The third feather has no continuous
bands (or only one), all the inner portions being fused; the outer mere scallops,
sometimes an oblique edging; generally, however, the interspaces of
the dark bands are more or less distinctly traceable through their dusky suffusion,
especially on the inner web of the outer feather. The number of free
bands thus varies slightly, but the general pattern is the same. This condition
prevails in nearly all the specimens before us from Yucatan and Mexico
(in only one specimen from Arizona, and one or two from Texas), and is
probably the typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalaris</i> of Wagler.</p>

<p>In specimens from the Rio Grande and across to Arizona the seven bands
of the outer feather are frequently continuous and complete on both webs
to the base, a slight suffusion only indicating the tendency to union in the
inner web. The other feathers are much as described, except that the white
interspaces of the black scallops penetrate deeper towards the shaft. This
is perhaps the race to which the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. bairdi</i> has been applied. We do
not find, however, any decided reduction in the amount of red on the anterior
portion of the head, as stated for this species (perhaps it is less continuous
towards the front), except in immature birds; young females possibly
losing the immature red of the crown, as with typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalaris</i>.</p>

<p>A third type of tail-marking is seen in specimens from the Pacific coast,
and from the Tres Marias especially; also in some skins from Southwestern
Arizona. Here the extreme forehead is black, with white spots; the red of
the crown not so continuous anteriorly even as in the last-mentioned race.
The general pattern of tail is as described, and the bars on the inner webs
are also confluent towards the base, but we have only two or three transverse
bars at the end of the outer feathers; the rest of outer web entirely
white, this color also invading the inner. The second feather is similarly
<!--571.png--><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 517]</span>
marked, sometimes with only one spot on outer web; the third has the
black scallops restricted. This may be called <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">graysoni</i>, as most specimens
in the Smithsonian collection were furnished by Colonel Grayson.
The size is equal to the largest typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalaris</i>.</p>

<p>We next come to the Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas bird, described by Mr. Xantus as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.
lucasanus</i>. Here the bill and feet become disproportionally larger and more
robust than in any described; the black bands of the back larger than the
white, perhaps fewer in number. The continuous red of the head also appears
restricted to a stripe above and behind the eye and on the occiput, although
there are some scattered feathers as far forward as above the eyes.
The specimens are, however, not in very good plumage, and this marking
cannot be very well defined; the red may really be as continuous forward as
in the last variety. The nasal tufts are brown, as in the typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalaris</i>.
The outer three tail-feathers in most specimens show still more white, with
one or two indistinct terminal bands only on the outer two; one or two
additional spots, especially on inner web, and the sub-basal patch of inner
web greatly reduced. Specimens vary here in this respect, as in other races
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalaris</i>, but the average is as described.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the decided difference between typical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalaris</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lucasanus</i>,
the discovery of the variety <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">graysoni</i> makes it possible to consider both
as extremes of one species. To <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuttalli</i>, however, it is but one step farther;
a restriction of the red to the posterior half of the top of head, the white
instead of brown nasal feathers, and the whiter under parts being the only
positive characters. The markings of the tail are almost identical with those
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lucasanus</i>. The anterior portion of the back is, however, not banded, as
in the several varieties described. For this reason it may therefore be questioned
whether, if <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lucasanus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalaris</i> are one, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuttalli</i> should not belong
to the same series.</p>

<p>We thus find that the amount of black on the tail is greatest in Southern
and Southeastern Mexican specimens, and farther north it begins to
diminish; in Western Mexico it is still more reduced, while at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Lucas the white is as great in amount as in the Upper Californian <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P.
nuttalli</i>.</p>

<p>The characters given above for the different varieties or races of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus
scalaris</i>, as far as they relate to the tail, may be expressed in the following
table, illustrated by the accompanying diagram, showing the markings of

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species belongs to our southern and southwestern fauna,
entering our borders from Mexico, occurring from the valley of the Rio
Grande to Southeastern California, and the slopes of
the Rocky Mountains south of the 35th parallel.
It is found throughout Mexico to Yucatan and Guatemala.</p>

<p>Dr. Samuel Cabot obtained a single specimen of
this bird at Yucatan, which he described under the
name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. parvus</i>, in the Boston Journal of Natural
History, <abbr title="Five, page">V, p.</abbr> 92. It was procured early in December,
1841, in the neighborhood of Ticul, Yucatan.
Dr. Kennerly considered it a not uncommon species
in the vicinity of Boca Grande; especially wherever
there were large trees. The same naturalist, in his
Report on the birds of Lieutenant Whipple’s expedition,
states that he very often saw this bird near
San Antonio, Texas, as well as during the march
several hundred miles west of that place, but that,
after leaving the Rio Grande, he did not meet with it until he reached the
head-waters of Bill Williams Fork. From thence to the Great Colorado
River he saw it frequently, wherever there was any timber; but it was
very shy, alighting on the tops of the leafless cotton-wood trees, and keeping
a vigilant lookout.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann, in his Report on the birds of Lieutenant J. G. Parke’s
expedition, states that he observed this Woodpecker in the southernmost
portion of California, and found it more and more abundant as he advanced
towards Texas, where it was quite common. The same naturalist, in his
Report on the birds of Lieutenant Williamson’s expedition, remarks that he
procured this bird first at Vallicita, but found it abounding in the woods
about Fort Yuma. He considered the species as new to the California
fauna, though frequently seen in Texas, several of the expeditions having
collected it.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodhouse, in his Report on the birds of Sitgreaves’s expedition to
the Zuñi and the Colorado speaks of finding this beautiful little Woodpecker
abundant in Texas, east of the Pecos River. During his stay in San Antonio
and its vicinity, he became quite familiar with it. It was to be seen,
at all times, flying from tree to tree, and lighting on the trunk of the mesquites
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Algarobia</i>), closely searching for its insect-food. In its habits and
notes, he states, it much resembles the common Hairy Woodpecker. Dr.
Woodhouse elsewhere remarks that he did not meet with this bird west of
the Rio San Pedro, in Texas. In regard to its breeding-habits, so far as I am
aware, they are inferred rather than known. It is quite probable they are
not unlike those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus pubescens</i>, which it so closely resembles. The
eggs in the collection of the Smithsonian were obtained with the collections
<!--573.png--><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 519]</span>
of the late Dr. Berlandier of Matamoras, in the province of Tamaulipas,
Mexico.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper states that this Woodpecker is abundant in the Colorado Valley,
and that they are sometimes seen on the bushes covering the neighboring
mountains. In habits he regards them the exact counterpart of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. nuttalli</i>,
to which they are allied.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser found them resident and very common throughout all Texas
and Northeastern Mexico. It breeds abundantly about San Antonio, boring
into any tree it finds most suitable for its purposes.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues regards Fort Whipple as about the northern limit of this species
in Arizona. It is not very common, is only a summer resident, and breeds
sparingly there. Farther south, throughout the Territory, and in the Colorado
Valley, he found it abundant. It does not cross the Colorado Desert
into California, and is there replaced by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. nuttalli</i>. It extends south into
Central America. A bird shot by Dr. Coues, June 5, appeared to be incubating;
young birds were taken just fledged July 10. The nest was in the
top of a live-oak tree. Malherbe, who speaks of this Woodpecker as exclusively
Mexican, states that he has been informed that it is abundant in
that country, where it may be seen at all times, climbing over the trunks
and branches of trees. It is said to be very familiar and unwary, living commonly
in gardens and orchards through the greater part of the year, and
many of them nesting there, though in regard to their manner of nesting he
has no information.</p>

<p>The egg of this Woodpecker in shape is most similar to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. villosus</i>,
being of an oblong-oval. It is larger than the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pubescens</i>, and not of so clear
a white color. It measures exactly one inch in length by .75 of an inch in
breadth.</p>

General appearance that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus nuttalli</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalaris</i>. Bill stout, as long
as or longer than the head. Above black, banded transversely with white on the back
and scapulars to the nape, the white narrower band, the rump and inner tail-feathers entirely
black; quills with a row of white spots on each web; the outer square, the inner
rounded, these spots on the tertials becoming transversely quadrangular. Beneath brownish-white,
with rounded black spots on the sides of the breast, passing behind on the flanks
and under tail-coverts into transverse bars. Greater inner wing-coverts transversely
barred. Outer two tail-feathers white, with one, sometimes two terminal bars, next to
which are one or two bars on the inner web only; third feather black, the outer web
mostly white, with traces of a terminal black bar; sometimes there is a greater predominance
of black on the inner web. Two white stripes on side of head, one starting
above, the other below the eye, with a tendency to meet behind and form a whitish
<!--574.png--><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 520]</span>
collar on the nape. Male with the entire top of the head streaked with red, becoming
more conspicuous behind; each red streak with a white spot at base. Feathers covering
the nostrils smoky-brown. Length, 7.15; extent, 12.15; wing, 4.00; bill above, 1.00;
middle toe and claw, .80; tarsus, .76.</p>

<p>Of the distinctness of this bird as a species from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. nuttalli</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalaris</i> I
had at one time no doubt; but the discovery that the otherwise typical
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalaris</i> from Mazatlan and Western Mexico generally have the same markings
on the tail has induced me to consider it as a kind of connecting link.
I have, however, thought it best to give a detailed description for comparison.
Of about the same size with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuttalli</i>, the bill and feet are much
larger. The legs, indeed, are nearly, if not quite, as large as those of
male <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. villosus</i> from Pennsylvania; the bill, however, is somewhat less.
The relations to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. scalaris</i> are seen in the dorsal bands extending to the
nape, the smoky-brown feathers of the nostrils, the red on the whole top
of head (scattering anteriorly), the brownish shade beneath, the width of
the white cheek-bands, etc. On the other hand, it has the black bands of
the back rather wider than the white, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuttalli</i>, and the white outer
tail-feathers even less banded with black. The two outer are entirely white,
with one terminal black bar; one or two spots on the outer web; and two
or three bands on the inner, with a sub-basal patch on the inner web, even
smaller than in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuttalli</i>. It is rarely that even two continuous transverse
bands can be seen to cross both webs of the tail. The bill and feet are
much larger.</p>

<p>The following measurements taken from the largest specimens before us
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dyctiopicus</i>, and one of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. villosus</i>, will illustrate what has been said of
the size of bill and feet of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. lucasanus</i>.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Specific Characters"><span class="sc">Sp. Char.</span></abbr>
Back black, banded transversely with white, but not on upper tail-coverts,
nor as far forward as the neck. Greater and middle coverts and quills with spots or
bands of white. Crown black, with white spots, sometimes wanting. On the nape a
patch of white, behind this unbanded black. Occiput and nape crimson in the male.
Tufts of feathers at the base of the bill white. Sides of the head black, with two white
stripes, one above the eye and passing down on the side of the neck, the other below
and cut off behind by black. Under parts smoky yellowish-white, spotted on the sides
of the breast, and banded on flank and crissum with black. Predominant character of
the outer tail-feather white, with two or three interrupted bands towards end; none at
base. Length, about 7.00; wing, 4.50. <i class="sex">Female</i> with the top of the head uniform black,
or sometimes spotted with white.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Coast region of California.</p>

<p>Third, fourth, and fifth quills nearly equal and longest; second intermediate
between the seventh and eighth. General color above black, barred
transversely with white on the back, rump, and flanks; the upper surface
of tail and tail-coverts, and a broad patch on the upper part of the back about
half an inch long, pure black. The white bands measure about .12 of an
inch, the black about twice as much. The top of the head is black, each
feather with a short streak of white; on the extreme occiput and the nape
is a transverse patch of crimson, each feather having a white spot just below
the crimson. The crimson patch is usually as far from the base of the bill
above as this is from its point. The sides of the head may be described as
black; a white stripe commences on the upper edge of the eye, and, passing
backwards, margins the crimson, and extends on down the side of the neck
to a patch of white, apparently connected with its fellow on the opposite
side by white spots. Another narrow white stripe commences at the
nostrils, (the bristles of which are whitish,) and passes as far as the occiput,
where it ceases in the middle of the black of the cheeks. There are thus
two white streaks on the side of the head bordering a black one passing
through the eye. The under parts generally are white, with a dirty yellow
tinge. The sides of the breast and body are faintly streaked with black;
the flanks barred with the same. The under coverts are barred with black.</p>

<p>The three outer tail-feathers are yellowish-white, with two or three interrupted
bars of black on the posterior or terminal fourth, and a concealed
patch of black on the inner web near the end. Only the terminal band is
<!--576.png--><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 522]</span>
continuous across, sometimes the others; always interrupted along the
shaft, and even reduced to rounded spots of black on one or both webs. No
distinct bands are visible on raising the crissum. The black patch on inner
web of outer tail-feather near the base increases on the second and third,
on the latter leaving the end only with an oblique white patch. The bands
on the under surface have a tendency to a transversely cordate and interrupted,
rather than a continuous, linear arrangement.</p>

<p>Young birds have the whole top of head red, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. scalaris</i>, with or
without white at the base of the red. The white nasal tufts and other
characters will, however, distinguish them.</p>

<p>This bird, though widely different in appearance from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalaris</i>, may nevertheless,
without any violence, be regarded as but one extreme of a species
of which the lighter examples of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalaris</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bairdi</i>) are the other, the transition
towards <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuttalli</i> being through <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalaris</i>, <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">graysoni</i>, and <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lucasanus</i>,
each in that succession showing a nearer approach to the distinctive
features of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuttalli</i>. We have not seen any intermediate specimens, however.
The pure white instead of smoky-brown nasal tufts, and their greater
development, are the only characters which show a marked difference from
the varieties of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalaris</i>; but the other differences are nothing more than
an extension of the black markings and restriction of the red in the male,
the result of a melanistic tendency in the Pacific region.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species was first discovered by Dr. Gambel near Los Angeles,
<abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>, and described by him in the Proceedings of the Philadelphia
Academy. Afterwards, in his paper on the birds of California, published in
the Academy’s Journal, mistaking it for the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. scalaris</i> of Wagler, he furnished
a fuller description of the bird and its habits, and gave with it illustrations
of both sexes. So far as now known, it appears to be confined to
the regions in California and Oregon west of the Coast Range, extending as
far south as San Diego, representing, in its distribution on the Pacific, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. borealis</i> of the Atlantic States. One specimen in the Smithsonian collections
was obtained on Umpqua River, in Oregon Territory; the others at
Santa Clara, San Francisco, Petaluma, Bodega, and Yreka, in California. Dr.
Woodhouse says, in his Report on the birds of the Zuñi and Colorado expedition,
that he has only seen this bird in California, from which region he
has examined numerous specimens. Dr. Heermann, in his Report on the birds
of Lieutenant Williamson’s expedition, states that this Woodpecker is occasionally
found in the mountains of Northern California, but that it is much
more abundant in the valleys. Dr. Gambel found it abundant in California
at all seasons. He describes it as having the usual habits of Woodpeckers,
familiarly examining the fence-rails and orchard-trees for its insect-fare.
He found it breeding at Santa Barbara, and on the 1st of May discovered a
nest containing young in the dead stump of an oak, about fifteen feet from
the ground. The hole for entrance was remarkably small, but inside appeared
large and deep. The parents were constantly bringing insects and larvæ.</p>

<p><!--577.png--><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 523]</span>
Dr. Cooper states that this Woodpecker is quite abundant towards the
coast of California, and among the foothills west of the Sierra Nevada. It
frequents the oaks and the smaller trees almost exclusively, avoiding the
coniferous forests. It is very industrious, and not easily frightened, when
engaged in hammering on the bark of trees allowing a very near approach.
At other times, when pursued, it becomes more wary and suspicious. April
20, 1862, Dr. Cooper discovered a nest of this bird near San Diego. It was
in a rotten stump, and was only about four feet from the ground. He captured
the female on her nest, which contained five eggs of a pure pearly
whiteness.</p>

<p>These birds are said to remain throughout the year in the valleys, and to
migrate very little, if at all. Dr. Cooper has not observed it west of the
Coast Range, except near Santa Barbara, nor has he seen any around gardens
or orchards. None have been observed north or east of the State. East of
the mountains it is replaced by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalaris</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Xantus mentions finding a nest containing two eggs in a hole in the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cereus giganteus</i>, about fifteen feet from the ground. The excavation made
by the bird was about a foot and a half deep and six inches wide.</p>

<p>This Woodpecker Mr. Ridgway saw only in the Sacramento Valley, where,
in June, it appeared to be a common species among the oaks of the plains.
He did not learn anything of its habits, but describes its notes as very
peculiar, the usual one being a prolonged querulous rattling call, unlike
that of any other bird known to him.</p>

<p>This subgenus is closely related in external form to the preceding, differing
in rather longer and more pointed wings and tail, the latter especially,
and a very small, short bill. The first quill (excluding the spurious one) is
considerably longer than the sixth, not shorter. The tail-feathers are much
attenuated at end. The most marked differences in coloration of the type
species, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. borealis</i>, consists in the absence of the post-ocular black patch,
leaving the whole auricular region white, and in the restriction of the red
to a very narrow line on each side, usually concealed.</p>

Fourth quill (not counting the spurious) longest. First nearer tip of fifth
than of sixth, intermediate between the two. Upper parts, with top and sides of the
head, black. Back, rump, and scapulars banded transversely with white; quills spotted
with white on both webs; middle and greater coverts spotted. Bristles of bill, under
parts generally, and a silky patch on the side of the head, white. Sides of breast and
body streaked with black. First and second outer tail-feathers white, barred with black
on inner web. Outer web of the third mostly white. A short, very inconspicuous
narrow streak of silky scarlet on the side of the head a short distance behind the eye,
along the junction of the white and black (this is wanting in the female); a narrow short
line of white just above the eye. Length, about 7.25; wing, 4.50; tail, 3.25.</p>

<p class="small">Hab. Southern States, becoming very rare north to Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>This species differs from the other banded Woodpeckers, as stated in the
diagnosis, in having a large patch of white behind the eye, including the
ears and sides of head, and not traversed by a black post-ocular stripe. The
bands of the back, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. nuttalli</i>, do not reach the nape, nor extend over
the upper tail-covert. The white patch occupies almost exactly the same
area as the black one in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuttalli</i>; the white space covered by the supra-orbital
and malar stripes, and the white patch on side of nape, of the latter
species being here black.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Cassin, southern specimens which he distinguishes as
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. querulus</i> from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. borealis</i> of Pennsylvania, differ in smaller number of
transverse bars on the back, and shorter quills, and in fewer white spots on
the wing-coverts and outer primaries. The black band on the back of neck
is wider. This therefore exhibits the same tendency to melanism, in more
southern specimens, that has been already indicated for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. villosus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scalaris</i>,
etc.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Red-cockaded Woodpecker has a restricted distribution to the
Southeastern Atlantic States, being rarely met with so far north as Pennsylvania.
Georgia and Florida are the only localities represented in the Smithsonian
collection, though other Southern States not named have furnished
specimens. It has been met with as far to the west as Eastern Texas and the
Indian Territory, where Dr. Woodhouse speaks of having found them common.
<!--579.png--><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 525]</span>
(Report of an Expedition down the Zuñi and Colorado Rivers,
Zoölogy, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 89.) Wilson only met with it in the pine woods of North Carolina,
Georgia, and South Carolina, and does not appear to have been acquainted
with its habits. Audubon speaks of it as being found abundantly
from Texas to New Jersey, and as far inland as Tennessee, and as nowhere
more numerous than in the pine barrens of Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas.
He found these birds mated in Florida as early as January, and
engaged in preparing a breeding-place in February. The nest, he states, is
not unfrequently bored in a decayed stump about thirty feet high. The eggs
he describes as smooth and pure white, and as usually four in number,
though he has found as many as six in a nest. The young crawl out of their
holes before they are able to fly, and wait on the branches to receive the food
brought by their parents until they are able to shift for themselves. During
the breeding-season the call of these birds is more than usually lively and
petulant, and is reiterated through the pine woods where it is chiefly
found.</p>

<p>Wilson compares the common call-notes of these birds to the querulous
cries of young birds. His attention was first directed to them by this
peculiarity. He characterizes the species as restless, active, and clamorous.</p>

<p>Though almost exclusively a Southern species, and principally found south
of North Carolina, individuals have been known to wander much farther
north. Mr. G. N. Lawrence obtained a specimen of this bird in Hoboken,
<abbr title="New Jersey">N. J.</abbr>, opposite New York City.</p>

<p>In quickness of motion this Woodpecker is said to be equalled by very
few of the family. Mr. Audubon states that it glides upwards and sideways,
along the trunks and branches, on the lower as well as the upper sides of
the latter, moving with great celerity, and occasionally uttering a short, shrill,
clear cry, that can be heard at a considerable distance. Mr. Audubon kept
a wounded one several days. It soon cut its way out of a cage, and ascended
the wall of the room as it would a tree, seizing such spiders and
insects as it was able to find. Other than this it would take no food, and
was set at liberty.</p>

<p>In the stomach of one dissected were found small ants and a few minute
coleopterous insects. In Florida it mates in January and nests in February.
In the winter it seeks shelter in holes, as also in stormy weather. Mr.
Audubon states that it occasionally feeds on grain and on small fruits.
Some go to the ground to search for those that have fallen from trees. They
are always found in pairs, and during the breeding-season are very pugnacious.</p>

<p>An egg of this species obtained near Wilmington, <abbr title="North Carolina">N. C.</abbr>, by Mr. N. Giles,
measures .95 by .70 of an inch. It is pure white, appeared less glossy than
the eggs of most Woodpeckers, and was of a more elliptical shape. Another
egg of this bird sent to me by Mr. Samuel Pasco of Monticello, <abbr title="Florida">Fla.</abbr>,
measures .98 by .70 of an inch, being even more oblong in shape, and corresponds
<!--580.png--><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 526]</span>
also in the absence of that brilliant polish so common in most
Woodpeckers.</p>

Cascade Mountains of Oregon and
southward into California. Sierra Nevada.</p>


<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This very plainly marked
Woodpecker, formerly considered very
rare, is now known to be abundant in
the mountains of Northern California and Nevada, as also in the mountain-ranges
of Washington Territory and Oregon. Dr. Cooper found it quite
common near the summits of the Sierra Nevada, latitude 39<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, in September,
1863, and procured three specimens. Three years previously he had met
with it at Fort Dalles, Columbia River. He thinks that its chief range of
distribution will be found to be between those two points. He also found
it as far north as Fort Colville, in the northern part of Washington Territory,
latitude 49<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>. He characterizes it as a rather silent bird.</p>

<p><!--581.png--><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 527]</span>
Dr. Newberry only met with this bird among the Cascade Mountains, in
Oregon, where he did not find it common.</p>

<p>Mr. J. G. Bell, who first discovered this species, in the vicinity of Sutter’s
Mills, in California, on the American River, represents it as frequenting the
higher branches of the pines, keeping almost out of gunshot range. Active
and restless in its movements, it uttered at rare intervals a sharp and clear
note, while busily pursuing its search for food.</p>

<p>Mr. John K. Lord states that the only place in which he saw this very
rare bird was in the open timbered country about the Colville Valley and
Spokan River. He has observed that this Woodpecker almost invariably
haunts woods of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinus ponderosa</i>, and never retires into the thick damp
forest. It arrives in small numbers at Colville, in April, and disappears
again in October and November, or as soon as the snow begins to fall. Although
he did not succeed in obtaining its eggs, he saw a pair nesting in the
month of May in a hole bored in the branch of a very tall pine-tree. It
seldom flies far, but darts from tree to tree with a short jerking flight, and
always, while flying, utters a sharp, clear, chirping cry. Mr. Ridgway found
it to be common in the pine forests of the Sierra Nevada, in the region of
the Donner Lake Pass. It was first observed in July, at an altitude of about
five thousand feet, on the western slope of that range, where it was seen playing
about the tops of the tallest dead pines. On various occasions, at all seasons,
it was afterwards found to be quite plentiful on the eastern slope, in the
neighborhood of Carson City, Nevada. Its habits and manners are described
as much like those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. harrisi</i>, but it is of a livelier and more restless
disposition. Its notes have some resemblance to those of that species, but
are of a more rattling character. It is easily recognized, when seen, by its
strikingly peculiar plumage.</p>

Bill about as long as the head, very much depressed at the base; the
outlines nearly straight; the lateral
ridge at its base much nearer the
commissure than the culmen, so as
to bring the large, rather linear nostrils
close to the edge of the commissure.
The gonys very long, equal to
the distance from the nostrils to the
tip of the bill. Feet with only
three toes, the first or inner hinder
one being wanting; the outer
lateral a little longer than the
inner, but slightly exceeded by the
hind toe, which is about equal to
the tarsus. Wings very long,
reaching beyond the middle of the
tail, the tip of the first quill
between those of sixth and seventh.
Color black above, with a broad patch of yellow on the crown; white beneath, transversely
banded on the sides. Quills, but not wing-coverts, with round spots. Lateral
tail-feathers white, without bands on exposed portion, except in European specimens.</p>

<p>The peculiarities of this genus consist in the absence of the inner hind
toe and the great depression of the bill. The figure above fails to represent
the median ridge of the bill as viewed from above.</p>

<p>This species differs from the other American three-toed Woodpeckers
chiefly in having the back entirely black. The white line from the eye is
usually almost imperceptible, if not wanting entirely. Specimens vary very
little; one from Slave Lake has a longer bill than usual, and the top of
head more orange. The size of the vertex patch varies; sometimes the
frontal whitish is inappreciable. None of the females before me have any
white spots in the black of head, as in that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">americanus</i>.</p>

<p>The variations in this species are very slight, being chiefly in the shade of
the yellow patch on the crown, which varies from a sulphur tint to a rich
orange. Sometimes there is the faintest trace of a whitish post-ocular
streak, but usually this is wholly absent. Western and Eastern examples
appear to be identical.</p>

<span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species has a well-defined and extended distribution, from
the Pacific to the Atlantic, and from the northern portions of the United
States to the extreme Arctic regions. In the United States it has been found
as far south as Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio, but rarely; and, so far as
I am aware, it is a winter visitant only to any but the extreme northern portions
of the Union, except along the line of the Rocky Mountains and the
Sierra Nevada. Audubon says it occurs in Northern Massachusetts, and in
all portions of Maine that are covered by forests of tall trees, where it constantly
resides. He saw a few in the Great Pine Forest of Pennsylvania,
and Dr. Bachman noticed several in the neighborhood of Niagara Falls,
and was of the opinion that it breeds in the northern part of New York.
The same writer describes the nesting-place of the Arctic Woodpecker as
generally bored in the body of a sound tree, near its first large branches.
He observed no particular choice as to the timber, having seen it in oaks,
pines, etc. The nest, like that of most of this family, is worked out by both
sexes, and requires fully a week for its completion. Its usual depth is
from twenty to twenty-four inches. It is smooth and broad at the bottom,
although so narrow at its entrance as to appear scarcely sufficient to enable
one of the birds to enter it. The eggs are from four to six, rather rounded
and pure white. Only one brood is raised in the season. The young follow
their parents until the autumn. In the southern districts where these
Woodpeckers are found, their numbers are greatly increased in the winter
by accessions from the North.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found this species quite numerous, in September, in the vicinity
of Lake Tahoe and the summits of the Sierra Nevada, above an altitude of
six thousand feet. From thence this bird has a northern range chiefly on
the east side of these mountains and of the Cascade Range. None were
seen near the Lower Columbia. At the lake they were quite fearless, coming
close to the hotel, and industriously rapping the trees in the evening and
in the early morning. Farther north Dr. Cooper found them very wild,
owing probably to their having been hunted by the Indians for their skins,
which they consider very valuable. He noticed their burrows in low pine-trees
near the lake, where he had no doubt they also raise their young. Dr.
Cooper has always found them very silent birds, though in the spring they
probably have more variety of calls. The only note he heard was a shrill,
harsh, rattling cry, quite distinct from that of any other Woodpecker.</p>

<p>The flight of this Woodpecker is described as rapid, gliding, and greatly
undulated. Occasionally it will fly to quite a distance before it alights,
uttering, from time to time, a loud shrill note.</p>

<p>Professor Verrill says this bird is very common in Western Maine, in
the spring, fall, and winter, or from the middle of October to the middle or
end of March. It is not known to occur there in the summer. Near Calais
a few are seen, and it is supposed to breed, but is not common. In Massachusetts
it is only a rare and accidental visitant, occurring usually late in
<!--588.png--><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 532]</span>
winter or in March. Two were taken near Salem in November. It is also
a rare winter visitant near Hamilton in Canada.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway met with but a single individual of this species during his
Western explorations. This was shot in February, near Carson City, Nevada;
it was busily engaged in pecking upon the trunk of a large pine, and was
perfectly silent.</p>

<p>Mr. John K. Lord obtained a single specimen of this bird on the summit
of the Cascade Mountains. It was late in September, and getting cold; the
bird was flying restlessly from tree to tree, but not searching for insects.
Both when on the wing and when clinging to a tree, it was continually
uttering a shrill, plaintive cry. Its favorite tree is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pinus contorta</i>, which
grows at great altitudes. It is found chiefly on hill-tops, while in the valleys
and lower plains it is replaced by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picoides hirsutus</i>.</p>

<p>Eggs of this species were obtained by Professor Agassiz on the northern
shore of Lake Superior. They were slightly ovate, nearly spherical, rounded
at one end and abruptly pointed at the other, of a crystal whiteness, and
measured .91 of an inch in length by .70 in breadth.</p>

<p>An egg received from Mr. Krieghoff is small in proportion to the size
of the bird, nearly spherical in form, and of a uniform dull-white color. It
measures .92 of an inch in length by .76 in breadth.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Specific Characters"><span class="sc">Sp. Char.</span></abbr>
Black above. The back markings of white, transverse in summer, and
longitudinal in winter; these extend to the rump, which is sometimes almost wholly
white. A white line from behind the eye, widening on the nape, and a broader one
under the eye from the loral region, but not extending on the forehead; occiput and sides
of head uniform black. Quills, but not coverts, spotted on both webs with white, seen on
inner webs of inner secondaries. Under parts, including crissum, white; the sides, including
axillars and lining of wing, banded transversely with black. Exposed portion of outer
three tail-feathers white; that of third much less, and sometimes with a narrow tip of
black. Upper tail-coverts sometimes tipped with white, and occasionally, but very rarely,
<!--589.png--><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 533]</span>
banded with the same. Top of the head spotted, streaked, or suffused with white; the
crown of the male with a yellow patch. Nasal bristles black, mixed with gray. Female
with the whole top of head usually spotted with white, very rarely entirely black.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Arctic regions of North America; southward in the Rocky Mountains to Fort
Buchanan; northern border of the Eastern United States, in winter (Massachusetts,
<span class="sc">Maynard</span>).</p>

<p>This species varies considerably in its markings, especially in the amount
of white above. The head is sometimes more coarsely spotted with white
than in the average; very rarely are the white spots wanting, leaving merely
the broad malar and interrupted post-ocular stripe. The rictal black stripe
is sometimes much obscured by white. In typical specimens from the Hudson
Bay and Labrador Provinces, which seem to be darkest, the feathers of
the centre of the back have three transverse bars of white (one of them
terminal), rather narrower than the intermediate black bars; the basal white
ones disappearing both anteriorly and posteriorly, leaving but two. In
specimens from the Mackenzie River district there is a greater development
of white; the white bands being broader than the black, and sometimes
extending along the shafts so as to reduce the black bars to pairs of spots.
The next step is the disappearance of these spots on one side or the other, or
on both, leaving the end of the feathers entirely white, especially anteriorly,
where the back may have a longitudinal stripe of white, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus villosus</i>.
Usually, however, in this extreme, the upper tail-coverts remain banded
transversely. In all the specimens from the Rocky Mountains of the United
States, especially Laramie Peak, this white back, unbarred except on the
rump, is a constant character, and added to it we have a broad nuchal patch
of white running into that of the back and connected with the white post-ocular
stripe. The bands, too, on the sides of the body, are less distinct. It
was to this state of plumage that the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. dorsalis</i> was applied, in
1858, and although in view of the connecting links it may not be entitled to
consideration as a distinct race, this tendency to a permanence of the longitudinal
direction of the white markings above seems to be especially characteristic
of the Rocky Mountain region, appearing only in winter birds from
elsewhere. This same character prevails in all the Rocky Mountain specimens
from more northern regions, including those from Fort Liard, and in
only one not found in that region, namely, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 49,905, collected at Nulato by
Mr. Dall. Here the middle of the back is very white, although the nuchal
band is less distinct. Other specimens from that locality and the Yukon
River generally, as also from Kodiak, distinctly show the transverse bars.</p>

<p>In one specimen (29,126) from the Mackenzie River, all the upper tail-coverts
are banded decidedly with white, and the wing-coverts spotted with
the same. Even the central tail-feathers show white scallops. The back is,
however, banded transversely very distinctly, not longitudinally.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. americanus</i> in all stages of color is distinguished from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arcticus</i> by the
white along the middle of the back, the absence of distinct frontal white
<!--590.png--><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 534]</span>
and black bands, more numerous spots of white on the head, etc. The inner
webs of inner secondaries are banded with white, not uniform black. The
maxillary black stripe is rather larger than the rictal white one, not smaller.
The size is decidedly smaller. Females almost always have the top of head
spotted with white instead of uniform black, which is the rule in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arcticus</i>.</p>

<p>It is probable that the difference in the amount of white on the upper
parts of this species is to some extent due to age and season, the winter
specimens and the young showing it to the greatest degree. Still, however,
there is a decided geographical relationship, as already indicated.</p>

<p>This race of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. tridactylus</i> can be easily distinguished from the European
form of Northern and Alpine Europe by the tail-feathers; of these, the outer
three are white (the rest black) as far as exposed, without any bands; the
tip of the third being white only at the end. The supra-ocular white stripe
is very narrow and scarcely appreciable; the crissum white and unbanded.
The back is banded transversely in one variety, striped longitudinally in the
other. In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. tridactylus</i> the outer two feathers on each side are white,
banded with black; the outer with the bands regular and equal from base;
the second black, except one or two terminal bands. The crissum is well
banded with black; the back striped longitudinally with white; the supra-ocular
white stripe almost as broad as the infra-ocular. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. crisoleucus</i>, of
Siberia, is similar to the last, but differs in white crissum, and from both
species in the almost entire absence of dark bands on the sides, showing the
Arctic maximum of white.</p>

<p>We follow Sundevall in using the specific name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">americanus</i>, Brehm, for this
species, as being the first legitimately belonging to it. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. hirsutus</i> of Vieillot,
usually adopted, is based on a European bird, and agrees with it, though
referred by the author to the American. The name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">undulatus</i>, Vieillot,
selected by Cabanis, is based on Buffon’s figure (<abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Planches enluminéz">Pl. enl.</abbr> 553) of a bird said
to be from Cayenne, with four toes; the whole top of the head red from base
of bill to end of occiput, with the edges of the dorsal feathers narrowly
white, and with the three lateral tail-feathers regularly banded with black,
tipped with red; the fourth, banded white and black on outer web, tipped
with black. None of those features belong to the bird of Arctic America,
and the markings answer, if to either, better to the European.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This rare and interesting species, so far as has been ascertained,
is nowhere a common or well-known bird. It is probably exclusively of
Arctic residence, and only occasionally or very rarely is found so far south as
Massachusetts. In the winter of 1836 I found a specimen exposed for sale
in the Boston market, which was sent in alcohol to Mr. Audubon. Two
specimens have been taken in Lynn, by Mr. Welch, in 1868. They occur,
also, in Southern Wisconsin in the winter, where Mr. Kumlien has several
times, in successive winters, obtained single individuals.</p>

<p>Sir John Richardson states that this bird is to be met with in all the
forests of spruce and fir lying between Lake Superior and the Arctic Sea, and
<!--591.png--><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 535]</span>
that it is the most common Woodpecker north of Great Slave Lake, whence
it has frequently been sent to the Smithsonian Institution. It is said to
greatly resemble <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. villosus</i> in habits, except that it seeks its food principally
upon decaying trees of the pine tribe, in which it frequently makes
holes large enough to bury itself. It is not migratory.</p>

Bill as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus</i>, but the lateral ridge, which is very prominent, running
out distinctly to the commissure
at about its middle,
beyond which the bill is
rounded without any angles
at all. The culmen and
gonys are very nearly
straight, but slightly convex,
the bill tapering rapidly
to a point; the lateral
outline concave to very
near the slightly bevelled
tip. Outer pair of toes
longest; the hinder exterior
rather longest; the
inner posterior toe very
short, less than the inner
anterior without its claw.
Wings long and pointed; the third, excluding the spurious, longest. Tail-feathers very
broad, abruptly acuminate, with a very long linear tip. Tongue scarcely extensible.</p>

<p>The genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphyropicus</i>, instituted in 1858, proves to be so strongly marked
in its characters that Dr. Coues proposes to make it the type of a distinct
subfamily, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sphyropicinæ</i> (<abbr title="Proceedings Philadelphia Academy">Pr. Phil. Acad.</abbr> 1866, 52). In addition to the peculiarities
already indicated, there is a remarkable feature in the tongue, which,
according to Dr. Coues, Dr. Hoy, Dr. Bryant, and others, is incapable of protrusion
much beyond the tip of the bill, or not more than the third of an
inch. Dr. Coues states that the apo-hyal and cerato-hyal elements of the
hyoid bone do not reach back much beyond the tympano-maxillary articulation,
instead of extending round, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus</i>, over the occiput to the top of the
cranium, or even curving into an osseous groove around the orbit. The basihyals
supporting the tongue are shorter and differently shaped. The tongue
itself is short and flattened, with a superior longitudinal median groove and
a corresponding inferior ridge; the tip is broad and flattened and obtusely
<!--592.png--><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 536]</span>
rounded, and with numerous long and soft bristly hairs. This is, of course,
very different from the long, extensile, acutely pointed tongue of other
Woodpeckers, with its tip armed with a few strong, sharp, short, recurved
barbs.</p>

<p>Dr. Hoy and Dr. Coues maintain that the food of these Woodpeckers consists
mainly of the cambium or soft inner bark of trees, which is cut out
in patches sometimes of several inches in extent, and usually producing
square holes in the bark, not rounded ones. As may be supposed, such proceedings
are very injurious to the trees, and justly call down the vengeance
of their proprietors. This diet is varied with insects and fruits, when they
can be had, but it is believed that cambium is their principal sustenance.</p>

<p>This strongly marked genus appears to be composed of two sections and
three well-defined species; the first being characterized by having the back
variegated with whitish, and the jugulum with a sharply defined crescentic
patch of black, though the latter is sometimes concealed by red, when the
whole head and neck are of the latter color, and the sharply defined striped
pattern of the cephalic regions, seen in the normal plumage, obliterated.
Comparing the extreme conditions of plumage to be seen in this type, as in
the females of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">varius</i> and of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ruber</i>, the differences appear wide indeed, and
few would entertain for a moment a suspicion of their specific identity; yet
upon carefully examining a sufficiently large series of specimens, we find
these extremes to be connected by an unbroken transition, and are thus led
to view these different conditions as manifestations of a peculiar law principally
affecting a certain color, which leads us irresistibly to the conclusion
that the group which at first seemed to compose a section of the genus is in
reality only an association of forms of specific identity. Beginning with the
birds of the Atlantic region (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. varius</i>), we find in this series the minimum
amount of red; indeed, many adult females occur which lack this color entirely,
having not only the whole throat white, but the entire pileum glossy-black;
usually, however, the latter is crimson. In adult males from this
region the front and crown are always crimson, sharply defined, and bordered
laterally and posteriorly with glossy-black; and below the black occipital
band is another of dirty white; the crimson of the throat is wholly confined
between the continuous broad, black malar stripes, and there is no
tinge of red on the auriculars; there is a broad, sharply defined stripe of
white beginning with the nasal tufts, passing beneath the black loral and
auricular stripe, and continuing downward into the yellowish of the abdomen,
giving the large, glossy-black pectoral area a sharply defined outline;
the dirty whitish nuchal band is continued forward beneath the black occipital
crescent to above the middle of the eye. The pattern just described
will be found in ninety-nine out of a hundred specimens from the Eastern
Province of North America (also the West Indies and whole of Mexico);
but a single adult male, from Carlisle, <abbr title="Pennsylvania">Penn.</abbr> (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 12,071, W. M. Baird), has
the whitish nuchal band distinctly tinged with red, though differing in
<!--593.png--><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 537]</span>
this respect only, while an adult female, from Washington, D. C. (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 12,260,
C. Drexler), has the lower part of the throat much mixed with red.</p>

<p>Taking next the specimens from the Rocky Mountains and Middle Province
of the United States (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. nuchalis</i>), we find that <em>all</em> the specimens possess
<em>both</em> these additional amounts of the red, there being always a red, instead
of dirty-white, nuchal crescent, while in the female the lower part of
the throat is always more or less red; in addition, the male has the red of
the throat reaching laterally to the white stripe, thus interrupting the black
malar one, which is always unbroken in the eastern form; and in addition,
the auriculars are frequently mixed with red. Proceeding towards the Columbia
River, we find the red increasing, or escaping the limits to which it is
confined in the normal pattern, staining the white and black areas in different
places, and tingeing the whitish which borders the black pectoral area.</p>

<p>Lastly, in the series from the Pacific coast (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. ruber</i>), we find the whole
normal pattern rendered scarcely definable&mdash;sometimes entirely obliterated&mdash;by
the extension of the red, which covers continuously the whole head,
neck, and breast; but nearly always the normal pattern may be traced, the
feathers of the normally black areas being dusky beneath the surface, and
those of the usual white stripes very white for the concealed portion.
Usually, in this form, the red of the breast covers only the black pectoral
area; but in extreme specimens it reaches back to the middle of the body
beneath, and stains the white spots of the back.</p>

<p>With the increase of the red as we proceed westward, there is also a decrease
in the amount of white above; thus, in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">varius</i> the whole back is
irregularly spotted with dirty white and black,&mdash;the former predominating,
the latter most conspicuous as a medial, broken broad stripe,&mdash;and the
lateral tail-feathers are much variegated by white spots. In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuchalis</i> the
back is mostly unbroken glossy-black, with two parallel <em>narrow</em> stripes of
white converging at their lower ends; and the lateral tail-feather is almost
wholly black, having merely a narrow white border toward the end. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. ruber</i>
is most like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuchalis</i>, but has the white still more restricted.</p>

<p>In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">varius</i> the bill is dark brown, in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuchalis</i> it is deep black, and in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ruber</i>
wax-brown. In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">varius</i> the yellow of the lower parts is deepest, in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuchalis</i>
just appreciable.</p>

<p>There is an occasional variation in the markings of the tail-feathers.

in 4,631, from the Upper Missouri, the outer web of the same feather has
nearly, and in 2,107, from Carlisle, it has quite, as much white as the inner
web. The outer webs do not appear to vary so much.</p>

<p>Specimens from the whole of Mexico, including even the west coast, are
referrible to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">varius</i>; they are probably winter migrants from the eastern
United States.</p>

<p>A female, from Washington, D. C. (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 12,260, C. Drexler), has the lower
half of the throat much mixed with red, as in <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuchalis</i>; but there is no
trace of this color on the nape. A male from Carlisle (<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 12,071, W. M.
Baird) has the nape distinctly tinged with red, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuchalis</i>, but the black
malar stripe is uninterrupted. Similar specimens have been taken in New
England, by Messrs. Brewster and Henshaw.</p>

<p>Many females occur with the entire pileum glossy-black, there being no
trace of red, though there are sometimes specks of white.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Yellow-bellied Woodpecker is found throughout the United
States, from the Gulf of Mexico on the south and the Atlantic on the east
to the Rocky Mountains, and is met with as far to the north as the 61st
parallel of latitude. Sir John Richardson found it common in the fur countries,
being the only Woodpecker that visits those regions in flocks. He
observed the Yellow-bellied Woodpecker on the north shore of Lake Huron
on the 14th of April, in 1825, and in 1827 it made its first appearance for
the season, on the plains of the Saskatchewan, on the 14th of May. Swainson
received specimens of this Woodpecker from Mexico. De la Sagra and
Dr. Gundlach both give it in their list of Cuban birds, though not as breeding
on that island. Gosse obtained several specimens in the months of
December, January, and February, in Jamaica, where he regarded it as only
a winter migrant from the northern continent. It is not given by the Newtons
among the birds of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Croix, but appears in Sclater’s list of the birds
of Central America, on the authority of Mr. George M. Skinner. Two
specimens have been taken in Greenland.</p>

<p>Wilson, in his account of its breeding habits, speaks of it as a resident
bird from Cayenne to Hudson’s Bay, as being common in the States of Kentucky
and Ohio, and as having been found in the neighborhood of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis.
He describes the habits of this species as similar to those of the Hairy and
Downy Woodpeckers, with which it generally associates. The only nest of
this bird which Wilson ever met with was in the body of an old pear-tree,
about ten or eleven feet from the ground. The hole was almost exactly circular,
small for the size of the bird, so that it crept in and out with difficulty;
but the excavation suddenly widened, descending by a small angle, and then
running downward about fifteen inches. On the smooth solid wood lay four
white eggs. This was about the 25th of May.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon, on the other hand, speaks of this species as returning to
Louisiana and the other Southern States only about the beginning of October,
remaining there during the winter, and again taking its departure before
<!--599.png--><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 541]</span>
the beginning of April, after which period he never observed it in those districts.
A few only, according to the same authority, breed in Kentucky, but
the greater number migrate to the more northern parts of the Union. He
describes it, in its habits, as preferring the interior of the forest during the
spring and summer, seldom showing itself near the habitation of man at
those seasons. It generally, he adds, bores its nest at a considerable height,
and usually in the trunk of an undecayed tree, immediately beneath a large
branch, and on its southern side. The hole is worked out by the male as well
as the female, in the manner followed by the other species, and to the depth
of from fifteen to twenty-four inches. The aperture is just large enough to
admit the birds, but the whole widens gradually towards the bottom, where
it is large and roomy. The eggs, which are from four to six, and pure white,
with a slight blush, are deposited on the chips without any nest. The
young seldom leave the hole until they are fully fledged.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon elsewhere speaks of having found this species extremely
abundant in the upper parts of the State of Maine and in the Provinces of
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick; but he saw none in Newfoundland or
Labrador.</p>

<p>For my specimens of the eggs of this species and valuable information as
to its habits, I am indebted to Mr. Charles S. Paine, of East Bethel, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>,
in which State it seems to be quite abundant. In a letter written in the
summer of 1860, he furnishes the results of his observations relative to their
habits, so far as they have fallen under his notice.</p>

<p>The Yellow-bellied Woodpeckers reach the central and northern parts of
that State about the 10th of April. They soon make their presence known
there by their loud and continued drumming, rather than tapping, on the
trunks and larger branches of decaying trees. Of this drumming they seem
to be peculiarly fond, especially where they can produce a loud ringing
sound. Sometimes, when Mr. Paine had been engaged in the process of preparing
maple sugar, he had left a few empty wooden buckets hanging on the
branches of trees, until needed for use. Upon these the bird will drum,
apparently with the greatest delight. At times they would experiment upon
the tin pails, but, being unable to obtain good standing-ground, they did not
follow it up. On such occasions their drumming did not appear to be
done in the pursuit of worms or food, but was very evidently for their own
entertainment, or in a spirit of rivalry one with another, as if seeking to
please their mates. When two male birds meet, they pursue each other
through the woods with great clamor. They have a loud, distinct, and lively
note, but their favorite music appears to be this drumming. They mate and
commence the excavation of their nests the last week in April. Their eggs
are usually deposited, in this section, somewhere between the 20th of May
and the first of June. The excavations for their nests are usually made in
the tops of large decaying trees. He adds that he found four or five of
these nests that year. The eggs of one of these he was able to obtain without
<!--600.png--><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 542]</span>
much trouble, the others had hatched. When the young leave their
nests they usually keep together, and often four or five may be seen playing
about the bark of the same tree while waiting for their parents to bring
them their food.</p>

<p>This species is far more abundant at the West than it is in the New England
States. In the States of Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts
it is very rarely met with. It is commonly known as the Sap-Sucker, and
much better deserves that name than do other species to which this term is
also applied. Owing to the peculiar formation of its tongue and the muscles
connected with it, it feeds less readily upon insects, and they form a smaller
proportion of its food. In the spring of the year these birds prey largely
upon the inner bark of trees, and where they exist in great numbers often do
a great deal of mischief. In April, 1868, I visited gardens in Racine, in company
with Dr. Hoy, where these Woodpeckers had every successive spring
committed their ravages, and was eyewitness to their performance. Their
punctures were unlike those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pubescens</i>, being much deeper, penetrating
the inner bark, and, being repeated in close proximity, becomes entirely
stripped off after a while, often resulting in the girdling and complete destruction
of the tree. In one garden of some considerable size, all the mountain-ash
and white-pine trees had thus been killed. In prairie countries,
where trees are a deficiency and their cultivation both important and attended
with difficulty, these birds prove a great pest, and in a few hours may
destroy the labor of many years. These habits, so well known to most of
our Western farmers, appear to have entirely escaped the notice of our older
ornithologists.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser found these birds near San Antonio at all seasons of the year,
but rather rare. He shot a couple near the Medina River, and Dr. Heermann
also procured the eggs in that neighborhood.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway says that in Southern Illinois this Woodpecker is only a
winter resident, coming from the north in September or October, and departing
in April. It is the only one of the eight species of Woodpeckers of
that section which does not breed there, and also the only one which is not
resident.</p>

<p>Specimens of its eggs from Vermont measure .95 by .70 of an inch. They
are of an oval shape, a little less rounded at one end than at the other.</p>

Markings, generally, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. varius</i>. A red nuchal crescent. Belly yellowish-white.
The red of the throat extending over and obliterating the black stripe from the
lower mandible, except on the side of the jaw. Post-ocular black patch tinged with red.
Secondaries with little or no white on outer webs. Tail-feathers black, scarcely varied;
the innermost with inner web, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">varius</i>. Female similar, but with the chin white;
the throat red, bordered, as in male, by a black stripe from the bill to the black pectoral
patch. Length, 8.00; wing, 5.00; tail, 3.50.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Middle Province of United States. Localities: Fort Mohave (<span class="sc">Cooper</span>, <abbr title="Proceedings California Academy">Pr. Cal.

<p>This bird, first indicated as a simple variety of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. varius</i>, is yet as decidedly
distinct and constant in its markings as a large number of what are considered
to be valid species. The principal differences from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">varius</i> have been
mentioned above: they consist mainly in the greater development of red, as
seen in wider throat-patch; nuchal crescent; tinge on cheek; a greater
amount of black, shown in unspotted outer webs of secondaries and blacker
tail, and in the paler colors below. The most striking peculiarity is in the
half-red throat of the female, which is entirely white in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">varius</i>. The light
markings of the back are more distinctly arranged in two lines enclosing a
median of black, which show no concealed white spots as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">varius</i>. The
breast is much paler, only slightly tinged with yellow, instead of the rich
color to which <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. varius</i> owes its trivial name.</p>

<p>Young birds vary in color to the same excessive degree as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">varius</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This form, closely allied to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">varius</i>, was at first known only
from the southern Rocky Mountains. Afterwards a large number of specimens
were obtained by Mr. C. Drexler at Fort Bridger, in Utah.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper procured a female specimen of this species at Fort Mohave, on
the 20th of February, 1861, which had probably wandered in a storm from
the mountains, and which was the only one he met with. Dr. Heermann
states, also, that they were not rare at Fort Yuma. Dr. Cooper’s bird was
silent and inactive, as if exhausted by a long flight. He also saw these birds
rather common as he crossed the mountains near latitude 48<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> in September,
1860, and noticed a great similarity in their habits to those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. varius</i>.
They chiefly frequented small deciduous trees, fed in the usual manner of
other Woodpeckers, and had also a shrill, unvaried call or note of alarm.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues found this Woodpecker an abundant and a permanent resident
in Arizona. Its distinctness as a species he did not question. Everywhere
common, it seemed to prefer live cottonwood-trees and willows. Two specimens
of this race have been taken in New England,&mdash;one in New Hampshire
by Mr. William Brewster, the other in Cambridge by Mr. Henshaw.</p>

<p>The Red-naped Woodpecker was found by Mr. Ridgway to be one of the
most abundant and characteristic species of the Wahsatch and Uintah
Mountains. It was also found, in greater or less numbers, throughout the
Great Basin, in the region of his route, and was even obtained on the eastern
Sierra Nevada, where, however, only one specimen was seen. Its favorite
resort, during summer, was the aspen groves in the mountains, at an altitude
<!--602.png--><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 544]</span>
averaging about seven thousand feet; and even when pine woods were near
the aspens were invariably chosen as nesting-places. Its excavations were
always in living trees, and the abandoned ones were taken possession of by
Purple Martins and White-bellied Swallows (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Progne subis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tachycineta
bicolor</i>) as nesting-places. In winter it was found among the cottonwoods
and willows of the river valleys. Its habits, manners, and notes are described
as almost perfectly similar to those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. varius</i>.</p>

<p>As stated in the remarks before the synopsis on page 1133, there is every
reason for considering this as merely a geographical race of a species, of
which <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuchalis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">varius</i> are the other forms. The differences from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">varius</i>
consist merely in an excessive amount of red, this obliterating the normal
pattern of the cephalic portions; and in an increased amount of black, or a
manifestation of the melanistic tendency so often distinguishing birds of the
Pacific coast region from their eastern co-specific representatives.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. nuchalis</i> is exactly intermediate in all respects between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. ruber</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S.
varius</i>,&mdash;the extremes,&mdash;while each of the latter is connected with the intermediate
race by specimens combining the characters of both races.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The geographical distribution of this form seems to be restricted
to the Pacific coast region.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper only met with these birds three times in Washington Territory.
This was in spring and fall. He speaks of them as being very shy, silent,
and retiring, remaining among the dense tops of the dark forest trees.
Whether it resides and breeds in the Territory he had no means of determining.
Dr. Suckley saw but one specimen, and regarded it as confined, for
the most part, to the close vicinity of the coast.</p>

<p><!--603.png--><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 545]</span>
Mr. Audubon assigns to it the same distribution, but is only able to give
the information in regard to its habits which he derived from the observations
of Mr. Nuttall, which, however, do not correspond with those of Dr.
Cooper. Mr. Nuttall states that this species, seen in the forests of the Columbia
and the Blue Mountains, has most of the habits of the common Red-headed
species. He concedes that it is less familiar, and that it keeps generally
among the tall fir-trees, in the dead trunks of which it burrows out a
hole for a nest, sometimes at a great elevation. On approaching one that
was feeding its young in one of these situations, it uttered a loud reverberating
<i class="birdcall">t’rr</i>, and seemed angry and solicitous at his approach. He adds that
this species also inhabits California, as well as the northwest coast up to
Nootka, and that it is found eastward as far as the central chain of the
Rocky Mountains. An egg taken from a nest which contained four was
1.25 in length and .75 of an inch in breadth. It was smooth, equally
rounded at both ends, though somewhat elongated, and pure white.</p>

<p>We are confident that there must be some mistake in this statement.
The disproportion between the length and the breadth is unprecedented.
Even in the most oblong egg there is rarely so much as twenty-five per cent
difference.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper, in his Birds of California, speaks of it as rather a northern bird,
having seen none south of Santa Clara, and there only in the mountains of
the Coast Range in early spring.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann found this form not at all rare in the Sierra Nevada Mountains,
and occasionally met a stray one among the valleys. Their call-note
was similar to the cry of a child in distress, and was very disagreeable.
In their quick, restless motions, and their untiring diligence in quest of food,
they resemble the rest of the Woodpecker family.</p>

<p>It was noticed by Mr. Ridgway only on the Sierra Nevada, and he is not
certain that he saw it on the eastern slope of that range.</p>

<p>Head and neck all round, sides of breast and body, upper parts generally,
wings, and tail, glossy greenish-black. A well-defined white stripe from the
nostrils (including the bristly nasal feathers) passing backwards under the
eye; another, nearly parallel, starting at the upper part of the eye, and nearly
meeting its fellow on the occiput. Chin and throat red along their central
line. A large patch on the wing, including the exposed portions of the
middle and greater coverts, white, although the anterior lesser coverts are
black. The inner face of the wings, excepting the smaller coverts, is black,
banded transversely on the inner primaries with white; the sides of body
behind and under tail-coverts white, with broadly V-shaped bands of black,
which color on the latter occupies the whole central portion of the feathers.
Rump and upper tail-coverts pure white; back with a few indistinct
and concealed spots of the same. Quills black; the margins of exterior
primaries spotted with white, the inner margins only of the remaining quills
with similar but larger and more transverse blotches. Middle of the body,
from the breast to the vent, sulphur-yellow, with the exception of the
type which had been preserved in alcohol (which sometimes extracts the
red of feathers). We have seen no specimen (except young birds, marked
female), in a considerable number, without red on the chin, and are inclined
to think that both sexes exhibit this character. Young birds from the Rocky
Mountains are very similar to the adult, but have the throat marked white,
and the inner web of innermost tail-feather banded with the same color.
<abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 16,090, <abbr title="male symbol">♂</abbr> ad. (Fort Crook, California), has a single crimson feather in
the middle of the forehead.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This comparatively new species of Woodpecker was first discovered
by Dr. Newberry in the pine forest on the eastern border of the
upper Klamath Lake. Its habits appeared to him to be very similar to those
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. harrisi</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. gairdneri</i>, which inhabit the same region. The individual
he procured was creeping up the trunk of a large yellow pine (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. brachyptera</i>),
searching for insects in the bark. Its cry was very like that of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. harrisi</i>. Although killed by the first fire, a second discharge was required
to detach it from the limb to which it clung fast.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Coues, it is resident and not uncommon in the Territory
of Arizona, occurring exclusively among the pine-trees. It is said to range
from both slopes of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, from as far north
at least as Oregon. Fort Whipple is supposed to be about its southern
limit. Dr. Coues states that this species possesses the anatomical peculiarities
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. varius</i>, and that its habits entirely correspond. Mr. Allen found
it abundant on the sides of Mount Lincoln, in Colorado Territory.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper met with a straggler of this species in the valley of the Colorado,
<!--605.png--><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 547]</span>
shot on the 12th of March, 1861. In September, 1863, he found them
rather common near the summit of the Sierra Nevada, latitude 39<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr>, where he
shot two. It has since been met with at Laramie Peak, and near the mouth
of the Klamath River.</p>

<p>It was found by Mr. Ridgway on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada,
and again on the Wahsatch Mountains; in both regions inhabiting the pine
forests exclusively, and in neither place at all common. It occurred so seldom
that Mr. Ridgway could learn but little concerning the peculiarities of
its habits, etc. Its common note is a plaintive wailing squeal, much like
that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. varius</i> (common to all the members of the genus), but other notes
were heard which were quite peculiar.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Specific Characters"><span class="sc">Sp. Char.</span></abbr>
About the size of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. varius</i>. Head dark ashy-brown; general color ashy-brown;
head and neck scarcely marked; middle line of belly sulphur-yellow; rump and
upper coverts pure white; rest of body apparently encircled by narrow transverse and
continuous bands (crossing the wings and tail) of black, the outer spaces becoming whiter
behind; a large round black patch on the breast. No red on top of the head. Male with
reddish chin. Length, about 9.00; wing, 5.00; tail, 4.10.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Cascade and Coast Ranges of California and Oregon; Sierra Nevada, Wahsatch,
and Rocky Mountains. Localities: West Arizona (<span class="sc">Coues</span>, <abbr title="Proceedings Academy of Natural Sciences">P. A. N. S.</abbr> 1866, 54).</p>

<p>In addition to the characters already assigned, the crown of the head is
indistinctly streaked or spotted with black. The under coverts are barred
with black. The tail-feathers are black, the inner and outer barred transversely
with white on both webs; the shafts, however, entirely black. The
quills are all spotted with white on both webs.</p>

<p>The jugular black patch shows more or less indication of the transverse
bands, and is sometimes wanting, leaving the bands distinct. In one specimen
(38,285 <abbr title="female symbol">♀</abbr>, Laramie Peak) it is remarkably large and almost unbroken,
while the black malar stripe is decidedly indicated; on the back the black
bars much exceed in width the light ones, which are nearly white. The
generic rictal white stripe is usually inappreciable, as also the black maxillary
one, although both can be detected in some specimens.</p>

<p>A young bird is not appreciably different from the adult.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Dr. Cooper regards this bird as quite a rare species. He has
never met with it, and doubts if it is ever found so far south as San Francisco.
<!--606.png--><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 548]</span>
Mr. J. G. Bell, of New York, was the first to meet with this bird in
the Lower Sierra Nevada.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann procured specimens among the southern mines, near the
Colorado River, where they were especially frequenting the pine-trees in
search of their food. He saw none of them alight on an oak, though those
trees were abundant in that locality. It has since been met with near Fort
Crook, and Dr. Cooper thinks it probable they may be more common in the
mountains of Eastern Oregon and in those of Central Utah.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues says that it is resident, but very rare, in Arizona. It frequents
pine-trees by preference. Its range is said to include both slopes of the Rocky
Mountains, from Oregon to the Rio Grande, and probably to Sonora.</p>

<p>Mr. Ridgway met with this rare Woodpecker on the Sierra Nevada and
Wahsatch Mountains, where it inhabited the same woods with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">S. williamsoni</i>;
it appeared to have the same manners and notes as that species, but it
was so seldom met with that nothing satisfactory could be learned concerning
its habits. Its conspicuously barred coloration gives it much the appearance
of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Centurus</i>, when flying.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="General Characters"><span class="sc">Gen. Char.</span></abbr>
Bill a little longer than the head; considerably depressed, or broader than
high at the base; shaped much as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Campephilus</i>, except shorter, and without the
bristly feathers directed forwards at the base of the lower jaw. Gonys about half the
length of the commissure. Tarsus shorter than any toe, except the inner posterior.
Outer posterior toe shorter than the outer anterior, and a little longer than the inner
anterior. Inner posterior very short, not half the outer anterior; about half the inner
anterior one. Tail long, graduated; the longer feathers much incurved at the tip. Wing
longer than the tail, reaching to the middle of the exposed surface of tail; considerably
graduated, though pointed; the fourth and fifth quills longest. Color uniform black.
Head with pointed occipital crest. A stripe from nasal tufts beneath the eye and down
side of neck, throat, lining of wing, and basal portion of under surface of quills, white;
some species with the abdomen and sides barred black and brownish-white; others with
a white scapular stripe in addition. Male with whole crown and crest and maxillary
patch red; female with only the crest red.</p>

<p>This genus is similar in general appearance and size to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Campephilus</i>, but
differs essentially in many respects; the differences being, however, mostly
those which distinguish all other Woodpeckers from the species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Campephilus</i>,
which is unique in the peculiar structure of the tail-feathers, the great
graduation of the tertials (sixth, instead of third or fourth, longest), and very
long gonys with the flat tuft of hair like feathers at its base. The less development
of the outer hind toe in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hylotomus</i>, which is about exactly intermediate
<!--607.png--><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 549]</span>
between the outer and inner anterior, the outer largest, instead of being
longest, and having the outer anterior intermediate between it and the
inner, the shorter bill, the gonys fully half the length of the commissure,
are additional distinctive features.</p>

<p>Of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hylotomus</i> there are several species in tropical America, all differing,
however, in transversely banded lower parts, while some have a broad white
scapular stripe; in these features of coloration (but in these only, for the head
pattern is always much as in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">H. pileatus</i>) they resemble closely species
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Campephilus</i> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. guatemalensis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. albirostris</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. malherbei</i>, etc.,) found in

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Wooded parts of North America from Atlantic to Pacific. Localities: E. Texas
(not Rio Grande!), (<span class="sc">Dresser</span>, Ibis, 1865, 469, breeds).</p>

<p>Specimens of this species from Fort Liard in the Northern Rocky Mountains,
and from Puget Sound region, are nearly four inches longer than those
from the Southern Atlantic States, and are scarcely exceeded in size by the
Ivory-billed Woodpecker.</p>

<p>Specimens from the northwest coast region (Columbia River, British
<!--609.png--><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 551]</span>
Columbia, etc.) have no trace of the white spots on ends of outer primaries,
always found in eastern specimens.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> No member of this large family has a wider distribution than
the Pileated Woodpecker, extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the extremest
limits of the northern forests, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
It seems to be a resident everywhere but in its extreme northern localities,
rather than a migratory species. There are specimens in the Smithsonian
collection from Nelson River, on the north, to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Johns River, Florida, on
the south, and from Pennsylvania on the east to the Rio Grande and the Columbia
on the west. Sir John Richardson (<cite>Fauna Boreali-Americana</cite>, <abbr title="Two, page">II, p.</abbr>
304) speaks of it as resident all the year in the interior of the fur countries,
up to the <abbr title="sixty-second">62d</abbr> or <abbr title="sixty-third">63d</abbr> parallels, rarely appearing near Hudson’s Bay, but frequenting
the gloomiest recesses of the forests that skirt the Rocky Mountains.
Dr. Woodhouse, in his Report on the natural history of the expedition
down the Zuñi and the Colorado Rivers, speaks of this Woodpecker as
having been found abundant in the Indian Territory, Texas, and New
Mexico. Neither Dr. Gambel nor Dr. Heermann give it in their lists of the
birds of California, nor does Dr. Newberry mention meeting with it in his
Report of the zoölogy of his route. Dr. Suckley, however, speaks of the
Log-Cock as abundant in the vicinity of Fort Steilacoom, Washington Territory,
during summer, and Dr. Cooper also mentions it as an abundant and
constant resident in the forests of the Territory. I have occasionally met
with it in the wilder portions of New Hampshire and Maine, but have nowhere
been so fortunate as to observe its nest or its breeding-habits. It has
always seemed a very shy bird, difficult of approach, always keeping at a
safe distance, and ever greeting your attempts for a nearer view with a loud,
cackling cry, not unlike a derisive laugh.</p>

<p>According to the observations of Wilson, their eggs are deposited in the
hole of a tree dug out by themselves, no other materials being used but the
soft chips of rotten wood. The female lays six eggs, of a snowy whiteness,
and they are said to raise two broods in a season.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon states that it almost always breeds in the interior of the
forest, and frequently on trees placed in deep swamps over the water, appearing
to give a preference to the southern side of the tree, on which side
the hole is usually found to which they retreat in the winter and during
stormy weather. The hole is sometimes bored perpendicularly, but occasionally
in the form of that of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker. The usual depth
is from twelve to eighteen inches, the breadth from two and a half to three,
and at the bottom five or six. He believed they raise but a single brood
in a season. The young follow their parents a long while, sometimes until
the return of spring.</p>

<p>Rev. Dr. Bachman gives an interesting account of a pair of Pileated
Woodpeckers building a nest in an old elm-tree in a swamp, and occupying
it the first year. Early the next spring two Bluebirds took possession of
<!--610.png--><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 552]</span>
it, and there had young. Before they were half grown the Woodpeckers
returned to the place, and, despite the cries and reiterated attacks of the
Bluebirds, took out the young and carried them away to some distance.
Next, the nest itself was disposed of, the hole cleaned and enlarged, and
there they raised their brood. The tree was large, but so situated that Dr.
Bachman could reach the nest from the branches of another. The hole was
eighteen inches deep, and he could touch the bottom with his hand. The
eggs, six in number, were laid on fragments of chips expressly left by the
birds, and were large, white, and translucent. Before the Woodpeckers began
to sit, he robbed them of their eggs to see if they would lay a second time.
They waited a few days as if undecided, and then he heard the female at
work again, deepening the hole and making it broader at the bottom. She
soon recommenced laying, this time depositing five eggs. He suffered her
to bring out her young, both birds alternately incubating, and each visiting
the other at intervals, looking in at the hole to see if all were right and well
there, and flying off afterwards in search of food. When the young were
old enough, he took them home and endeavored to raise them. Three
died, refusing all food. With two he was more successful. But even these
he found untamable and destructive and troublesome pets, which he was at
last glad to release.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper, who observed this species in Washington Territory, discovered
a pair early in April on Whitby’s Island, burrowing out a hole for their
nest in a dead trunk, about thirty feet from the ground. They worked alternately,
and were very watchful, keeping perfectly silent while they heard any
noise near by. He found the place by noticing chips on the bushes below,
and after watching silently for some time, one of them began to work, now
and then protruding its bill full of chips, and, after cautiously looking round,
dropping them.</p>

<p>According to Mr. C. S. Paine, of Randolph, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, the Pileated Woodpecker
is very rare in Vermont, and extremely shy. It is difficult to approach one
nearer than from fifteen to twenty rods, except by surprise. He adds that
in only a single instance has he been able to shoot one. This fell with a
broken wing. Before he could reach it, the bird commenced climbing a tree,
and nearly escaped. When overtaken, it fought furiously, and wounded Mr.
Paine severely in the hand, setting up at the same time a loud outcry, not
unlike that of a domestic hen. He has never met with its nest, although he
has several times seen the young when just able to leave it. The elder
Mr. Paine states that, some fifty years previous, this species was abundant in
Vermont, and not at all timid, and is of the opinion that their present shyness
is all that exempts them from extermination.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser found this Woodpecker resident and quite numerous in Texas
near all the large rivers, where the timber is heavy. A few were seen on
the Medina, and their eggs obtained there, but they were not abundant in
that district. On the Colorado and Brazos Rivers these birds were very common,
<!--611.png--><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 553]</span>
and Mr. Dresser found several nests in huge cottonwood-trees, but had
no means of getting to them.</p>

<p>Mr. J. K. Lord assigns to this species a wide western range, being common
both east and west of the Cascades, and on the west slope of the Rocky
Mountains. He met with it north as far as Fort Rupert in Vancouver
Island, and south through Oregon and California. He found them at Colville
during the winter. He states that they nest in May, generally in a
tall dead pine-tree, at a great height.</p>

<p>For my first specimens of the eggs of this species I am under obligations
to Dr. Cornelius Kollock, of Cheraw, <abbr title="South Carolina">S. C.</abbr> They were obtained by him
from excavations made in large trees at the height of about twenty-five feet
from the ground, and in localities at no great distance from the inhabited
parts of the country.</p>

<p>The eggs of this species from South Carolina and Florida are of a very
brilliant crystalline whiteness, of a rounded-oval shape, and measure 1.25
inches in length by 1.02 in breadth. Northern specimens are probably
larger.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Red-bellied Woodpecker
is distributed throughout North
America, from the Atlantic Coast to
the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains.
It is, however, much more abundant
in the more southern and western
portions. In the collections of the
Smithsonian Institution none are recorded
from farther north than Pennsylvania
on the east and Nebraska Territory on the west, while others were
obtained as far south as Florida. Nor am I aware that it is found, except
very rarely, north of Pennsylvania on the Atlantic coast. I have never met
with it in Eastern Massachusetts, although Mr. Audubon speaks of it as breeding
from Maryland to Nova Scotia. Dr. Woodhouse found it common in the
Indian Territory and in Texas. Wilson speaks of having found it abundant
in Upper Canada, and in the northern parts of the State of New York. He
also refers to its inhabiting the whole Atlantic States as far as Georgia and
the southern extremity of Florida. Its absence in Eastern Massachusetts
was noticed by Mr. Nuttall. It is not given by Thompson or Paine as
<!--616.png--><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 556]</span>
one of the birds of Vermont, nor does Lieutenant Bland mention it as one
of the birds of Nova Scotia, and it is not included by Sir John Richardson
in the <cite>Fauna Boreali-Americana</cite>.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon speaks of it as generally more confined to the interior of
forests than the Hairy Woodpecker, especially during the breeding-season.
He further states that he never met with its nest in Louisiana or South
Carolina, but that it was not rare in Kentucky, and that, from the State of
Maryland to Nova Scotia, it breeds in all convenient places, usually more in
the woods than out of them. He also states that he has found the nests in
orchards in Pennsylvania, generally not far from the junction of a branch
with the trunk. He describes the hole as bored in the ordinary manner.
The eggs are seldom more than four in number, and measure 1.06 inches in
length and .75 of an inch in breadth. They are of an elliptical form, smooth,
pure white, and translucent. They are not known to raise more than one
brood in a season.</p>

<p>Wilson speaks of this species as more shy and less domestic than the Red-headed
or any of the other spotted Woodpeckers, and also as more solitary.
He adds that it prefers the largest high-timbered woods and the tallest decayed
trees of the forest, seldom appearing near the ground, on the fences,
or in orchards or open fields. In regard to their nesting, he says that the
pair, in conjunction, dig out a circular cavity for the nest in the lower
side of some lofty branch that makes a considerable angle with the horizon.
Sometimes they excavate this in the solid wood, but more generally in a
hollow limb, some fifteen inches above where it becomes solid. This is
usually done early in April. The female lays five eggs, of a pure white, or
almost semi-transparent. The young generally make their appearance
towards the latter part of May. Wilson was of the opinion that they produced
two broods in a season.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser found this bird resident and abundant in Texas. It is also
equally abundant in Louisiana and in Florida, and Mr. Ridgway considers
it very common in Southern Illinois. Neither Mr. Boardman nor Mr.
Verrill have found it in Maine. Mr. McIlwraith has, however, taken three
specimens at Hamilton, Canada West, May 3, near Chatham. Mr. Allen
gives it as a summer visitant in Western Massachusetts, having seen one on
the 13th of May, 1863. It has also been taken several times in Connecticut,
by Professor Emmons, who met with it, during the breeding-season, in
the extreme western part of the State. Mr. Lawrence has found it near
New York City, and Mr. Turnbull in Eastern Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The eggs vary from an oblong to a somewhat rounded oval shape, are of a
bright crystalline whiteness, and their measurements average 1.02 inches in
length by .88 of an inch in breadth.</p>

<p>Young birds are not different from adults, except in showing indication of

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This beautiful Woodpecker is abundant throughout the valley
of the Rio Grande, from Eagle Pass to its mouth; how far to the west within
our boundaries it occurs, I am not able to state. It is common throughout
Mexico, and was found in the Guatemalan collection of Van Patten, though
not mentioned by Sclater and Salvin. Dr. Woodhouse, in his Report on the
zoölogy of Captain Sitgreaves’s expedition, speaks of finding it quite abundant
in the neighborhood of San Antonio, Texas. He adds that west of the
Rio San Pedro he did not meet with it. He speaks of it as having a loud,
sharp cry, which it utters as it flies from tree to tree. He observed it mostly
on the trunks of the mesquite (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Algarobia</i>), diligently searching in the usual
manner of Woodpeckers. In the Report upon the birds of the Mexican
Boundary Survey, it is mentioned by Mr. Clark as abundant on the Lower
Rio Grande, as very shy, and as keeping chiefly about the mesquite. Lieutenant
Couch speaks of it as very common throughout Tamaulipas.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser found the Yellow-bellied Woodpecker plentiful from the
Rio Grande to San Antonio, and as far north and east as the Guadaloupe,
after which he lost sight of it. Wherever the mesquite-trees were large,
there it was sure to be found, and very sparingly elsewhere. Near San
Antonio it is quite common, but not so much so as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. carolinus</i>. At
Eagle Pass, however, it was the more abundant of the two. He found it
<!--618.png--><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 558]</span>
breeding near San Antonio, boring for its nest-hole into a mesquite-tree.
Mr. Dresser was informed by Dr. Heermann, who has seen many of their
nests, that he never found them in any other tree.</p>

<p>These birds were found breeding by Dr. Berlandier, and his collection. contained
quite a number of their eggs. Nothing was found among his papers
in relation to their habits or their manner of breeding. Their eggs, procured
by him, are of an oblong-oval shape, and measure 1.05 inches in length by
.85 of an inch in breadth.</p>

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Lower Colorado River of the West, to Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas. South to Mazatlan.
Localities: W. Arizona (<span class="sc">Coues</span>, <abbr title="Proceedings Academy of Natural Sciences">P. A. N. S.</abbr> 1866, 54).</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species was first discovered by Dr. Kennerly in his route
along the 35th parallel, and described by Professor Baird, in 1854. The
Doctor encountered it almost continually during the entire march along the
Big Sandy, Bill Williams Fork, and the Great Colorado; but it was so very
shy that he had great difficulty in procuring specimens. Seated in the top of
the tree, it was ever on guard; and, upon the approach of danger, flew away,
accompanying its flight with the utterance of very peculiar notes. Its flight
was in an undulating line, like that of other birds of this class.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann found this Woodpecker abundant on the banks of the
Gila River among the mesquite-trees. The giant cactus, often forty feet
high, which grows abundantly on the arid hillsides throughout that whole
section of country, was frequently found filled with holes bored out by
this bird. The pith of the plant is extracted until a chamber of suitable
size is obtained, when the juice exuding from the wounded surface hardens,
and forms a smooth dry coating to the cavity, thus making a convenient
<!--619.png--><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 559]</span>
place for the purposes of incubation. At Tucson, in Arizona, he found it
frequenting the cornfields, where it might be seen alighting on the old hedge-posts
in search of insects. Its note, he adds, resembles very much that of
the Red-headed Woodpecker. He afterwards met with this bird in California,
in considerable numbers, on the Colorado. Besides its ordinary notes,
resembling those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melanerpes erythrocephalus</i>, it varies them with a soft
plaintive cry, as if hurt or wounded. He found their stomachs filled with
the white gelatinous berry of a parasitic plant which grows abundantly on
the mesquite-trees, and the fruit of which forms the principal food of many
species of birds during the fall.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues gives this bird as rare and probably accidental in the immediate
vicinity of Fort Whipple, but as a common bird in the valleys of the Gila
and of the Lower Colorado, where it has the local name of <i lang="en" xml:lang="en">Suwarrow</i>, or
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Saguaro</i>, on account of its partiality for the large cactuses, with the juice of
which plant its plumage is often found stained.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper found this Woodpecker abundant in winter at Fort Mohave,
when they feed chiefly on the berries of the mistletoe, and are very shy.
He rarely saw them pecking at the trees, but they seemed to depend for a
living on insects, which were numerous on the foliage during the spring.
They have a loud note of alarm, strikingly similar to that of the <a name="note31" id="note31"></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Phainopepla
nitens</i>, which associated with them in the mistletoe-boughs.</p>

<p>About the 25th of March he found them preparing their nests in burrows
near the dead tops of trees, none of them, so far as he saw, being accessible.
By the last of May they had entirely deserted the mistletoe, and were probably

Bill about equal to the head; broader than high at the base, but becoming
compressed immediately anterior to the commencement of the gonys. Culmen and
gonys with a moderately decided angular ridge; both decidedly curved from the very
base. A rather prominent acute ridge commences at the base of the mandible, a little
below the ridge of the culmen, and proceeds but a short distance anterior to the nostrils
(about one third of the way), when it sinks down, and the bill is then smooth. The
lateral outlines are gently concave from the basal two thirds; then gently convex to the
tip, which does not exhibit any abrupt bevelling. Nostrils open, broadly oval; not concealed
by the feathers, nor entirely basal. Fork of chin less than half lower jaw. The
outer pair of toes equal. Wings long, broad; lengthened. Tail-feathers broad, with
lengthened points.</p>

<p class="small">The species all have the back black, without any spots or streaks anywhere.</p>

Western America from Black Hills to Pacific.</p>

<p>The peculiarities in the feathers of the under parts have already been adverted
to. This structure appears to be essentially connected with the red
feathers, since these have the same texture in the other species of the genus,
wherever the color occurs. The remark may perhaps apply generally to the
red feathers of most, if not all, Woodpeckers, and may be connected with
some chemical or physical condition yet to be determined.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> Lewis’s Woodpecker would seem to have a distribution throughout
the Pacific Coast, from the sea-shore to the mountains, and from Puget
Sound to the Gulf of California, and extending to the eastern border of the
Great Plains, within the limits of the United States. They were first observed
by Messrs. Lewis and Clarke, in their memorable journey to the
Pacific. Subsequently Mr. Nuttall met with them in his westward journey,
in the central chain of the Rocky Mountains. This was in the month of
July. Among the cedar and pine woods of Bear River, on the edge of Upper
California, he found them inhabiting the decayed trunks of the pine-trees,
and already feeding their young. Afterwards, at the close of August, he met
them in flocks on the plains, sixty miles up the Wahlamet. He describes
them as very unlike Woodpeckers in their habits, perching in dense flocks,
like Starlings, neither climbing branches nor tapping in the manner of their
tribe, but darting after insects and devouring berries, like Thrushes. He saw
them but seldom, either in the dense forests of the Columbia or in any settled
part of California.</p>

<p>Townsend speaks of their arriving about the first of May on Bear River
and the Columbia. Both sexes incubate, according to his observations.</p>

<p>Dr. Gambel first observed this Woodpecker in a belt of oak timber near
the Mission of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gabriel, in California, and states that it was abundant.
He also describes its habits as peculiar, and unlike the generality of Woodpeckers.
Dr. Heermann, too, speaks of finding it in all the parts of California
which he visited. Dr. Newberry, in his Notes on the zoölogy of
Lieutenant Williamson’s expedition, refers to it as most unlike the California
Woodpecker in the region it occupies and in its retiring habits. He
describes it as seeming to choose, for its favorite haunts, the evergreen
forests upon the rocky declivities of the Cascade and Rocky Mountains.
He first observed it in Northern California, but subsequently noticed it in
the mountains all the way to the Columbia. Though often seen in low elevations,
it was evidently alpine in its preferences, and was found most frequently
near the line of perpetual snow; and when crossing the snow lines,
in the mountain-passes, it was often observed flying far above the party. He
describes it as being always shy, and difficult to shoot.</p>

<p>Dr. S. W. Woodhouse describes this species as being common in the Indian
<!--623.png--><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 563]</span>
Territory and in New Mexico; while Dr. Cooper, in his Report on the
zoölogy of Washington Territory, speaks of it as being common, during
summer, in all the interior districts, but seldom or never approaching the
coast. It arrives at Puget Sound early in May, and some even remain, during
mild winters, in the Territory. According to his account, it burrows
holes for its nests at all heights from the ground, but commonly in dead
trees. The eggs are described as pure white, and, when fresh, translucent,
like those of all the Woodpecker tribe, and hardly distinguishable in size
and general appearance from those of the Golden-winged Woodpecker
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colaptes auratus</i>). Its harsh call is rarely uttered in summer, when it
seems to seek concealment for itself and nest. The flocks of young, which
in fall associate together to the number of eight or ten, are more noisy. Dr.
Suckley, in the same Report (page 162), speaks of this Woodpecker as being
very abundant throughout the more open portions of the timbered region of
the northwest coast, preferring oak openings and groves. At Fort Dalles, on
the Columbia, they are extremely numerous, not only breeding there during
summer, but also found as winter residents. Their breeding-places are generally
holes in oak and other trees, which, from the appearance of all he
examined, seemed to have been excavated for the purpose. At Puget Sound
this species was found less frequently than at Fort Dalles, on the Columbia.
At the latter place they were constant winter residents. Dr. Suckley also
speaks of them as being semi-gregarious in their habits.</p>

<p>Mr. Lord thinks that this Woodpecker is not to be met with west of the
Cascade Mountains, but says it is very often found between the Cascades and
the Rocky Mountains, where it frequents the open timber. The habits and
modes of flight of this bird, he states, are not the least like a Woodpecker’s.
It flies with a heavy flapping motion, much like a Jay, feeds a good deal on
the ground, and chases insects on the wing like a Shrike or a Kingbird.
Whilst mating they assemble in large numbers, and keep up a continual,
loud, chattering noise. They arrive at Colville in April, begin nesting in
May, and leave again in October. The nest is in a hole in a dead pine-tree,
usually at a considerable height from the ground.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues says this bird is very common at Fort Whipple, in Arizona,
where it remained in moult until November.</p>

<p>Mr. J. A. Allen found this the most numerous of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picidæ</i> in Colorado
Territory. He also states that it differs considerably in its habits from
all the other Woodpeckers. He frequently noticed it rising high into the
air almost vertically, and to a great height, apparently in pursuit of insects,
and descending again as abruptly, to repeat the same manœuvre. It was
met with by Mr. Ridgway in the Sacramento Valley, along the eastern base
of the Sierra Nevada, and in the East Humboldt Mountains. In the first-mentioned
locality it was the most abundant Woodpecker, and inhabited the
scattered oaks of the plains. In the second region it was very abundant&mdash;perhaps
more so than any other species&mdash;among the scattered pines along
<!--624.png--><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 564]</span>
the very base of the eastern slope; and in the last-mentioned place was observed
on a few occasions among the tall aspens bordering the streams in
the lower portions of the cañons. In its habits it is described as approaching
most closely to our common Red-headed Woodpecker (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. erythrocephalus</i>),
but possessing many very distinctive peculiarities. In the character
of its notes it quite closely approximates to our common Redhead, but
they are weaker and of a more twittering character; and in its lively playful
disposition it even exceeds it. It has a very peculiar and characteristic
habit of ascending high into the air, and taking a strange, floating flight,
seemingly laborious, as if struggling against the wind, and then descending
in broad circles to the trees.</p>

<p>The eggs are more spherical than are usually those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colaptes auratus</i>,
are of a beautiful crystalline whiteness, and measure 1.10 inches in length
and .92 of an inch in breadth.</p>

<p>Western specimens frequently have the abdomen strongly tinged with

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Red-headed Woodpecker is one of the most familiar birds
of this family, and ranges over a wide extent of territory. Excepting where
it has been exterminated by the persecutions of indiscriminate destroyers, it
is everywhere a very abundant species. Once common, it is now rarely met
<!--625.png--><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 565]</span>
with in the neighborhood of Boston, though in the western part of Massachusetts
it is still to be found. In the collections of the Smithsonian Institution
are specimens from Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas,
Missouri, Louisiana, the Indian Territory, etc. Sir John Richardson speaks
of it as ranging in summer as far north as the northern shores of Lake
Huron. He also remarks that in the Hudson Bay Museum there is a specimen
from the banks of the Columbia River. Dr. Gambel, in his paper on
the birds of California, states that he saw many of them in a belt of oak timber
near the Mission of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gabriel. As, however, Dr. Heermann did not
meet with it in California, and as no other collector has obtained specimens
in that State, this is probably a mistake. With the exception of Dr. Woodhouse,
who speaks of having found this species in the Indian Territory and
in Texas, it is not mentioned by any of the government exploring parties.
It may therefore be assigned a range extending, in summer, as far north as
Labrador, and westward to the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains.
Throughout the year it is a permanent resident only of the more southern
States, where it is, however, much less abundant in summer than it is in
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Wilson, at the time of his writing (1808), speaks of finding several of the
nests of this Woodpecker within the boundaries of the then city of Philadelphia,
two of them being in buttonwood-trees and one in the decayed
limb of an elm. The parent birds made regular excursions to the woods
beyond the Schuylkill, and preserved a silence and circumspection in visiting
their nest entirely unlike their habits in their wilder places of residence.
The species is altogether migratory, visiting the Middle and Northern States
early in May and leaving in October. It begins the construction of its nest
almost immediately after its first appearance, as with other members of its
family, by excavations made in the trunk or larger limbs of trees, depositing
six white eggs on the bare wood. The cavities for their nests are made
almost exclusively in dead wood, rarely, if ever, in the living portion of the
tree. In Texas, Louisiana, Kentucky, and the Carolinas, they have two
broods in a season, but farther north than this they rarely raise more than
one. Their eggs are usually six in number, and, like all the eggs of this
family, are pure white and translucent when fresh. They vary a little in
their shape, but are usually slightly more oval and less spherical than those
of several other species. Mr. Nuttall speaks of the eggs of this bird as
being said to be marked at the larger end with reddish spots. I have never
met with any thus marked, and as Mr. Nuttall does not give it as from his
own observations I have no doubt that it is a mistake. Mr. Paine, of
Randolph, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, writes that he has only seen a single specimen of this
Woodpecker in that part of Vermont, while on the western side of the
Green Mountains they are said to be very common. He adds that it is a
tradition among his older neighbors that these Woodpeckers were formerly
everywhere known throughout all portions of the State.</p>

<p><!--626.png--><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 566]</span>
Mr. Ridgway saw a single individual of this species in the outskirts of
Salt Lake City, in July, 1869.</p>

<p>Their eggs vary both in size and in shape, from a spherical to an oblong-oval,
the latter being the more usual. Their length varies from 1.10 to 1.15

Dr. Coues calls attention to extraordinary differences in the color of the
iris, which varies from white to red, blue, yellow, ochraceous, or brown. A
mixture of blue, he thinks, indicates immaturity, and a reddish tinge the
full spring coloration.</p>

<p>The male of this species has a white forehead extending a little backwards
of the anterior edge of the eye, the rest of the top of head to the nape being
red. The female has the white forehead, and a quadrate occipito-nuchal red
patch, a black band about as broad as the white one separating the latter
from the occipital red. The length of the two anterior bands together is
decidedly greater than that of the posterior red. In both sexes the jugulum
is entirely and continuously black. Anteriorly (generally with a red spot in
its anterior edge) and on the feathers of its posterior border only are these
elongated white spots, on each side the shaft, the feathers of the breast being
streaked centrally with black. The inner webs of the secondaries have an
elongated continuous patch of white along their internal edge, with a very
slight, almost inappreciable, border of black; this white only very rarely converted
partly or entirely into quadrate spots, and that never on the innermost
quills marked with white. Specimens from California are very similar
to those from the Rocky Mountains and the Rio Grande Valley, except,
perhaps, in being larger, with longer and straighter bill.</p>

<p>In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. flavigula</i> from Bogota, the male has the head marked with the red,
black, and white (the red much less in extent, however) of the female <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M.
formicivorus</i>, while the female has no red whatever. All, or nearly all, the
feathers of the jugulum have the two white spots, and (as pointed out by
Reichenbach) the white of the inner webs of the inner quills is entirely converted
into a series of non-confluent quadrate spots. The black streaks on
the sides and behind appear to be of greater magnitude, and more uniformly
distributed. In both species all the tail-feathers are perfectly black.</p>

<p>A Guatemalan bird, received from Mr. Salvin as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. formicivorus</i>,&mdash;and indeed
all specimens from Orizaba and Mirador to Costa Rica,&mdash;agrees in the
main with the northern bird, except that all the black feathers of the jugulum
have white spots, as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. flavigula</i>. The outermost tail-feather of Mr.
Salvin’s specimen has two narrow transverse whitish bands, and a spot indicating
a third, as well as a light tip. The white markings on the inner
quills are more like the northern bird, though on the outermost ones there
is the same tendency to form spots as in a few northern specimens (as
6,149 from Los Nogales, &amp;c.). The bill is very different from either in being
shorter, broader, much stouter, and the culmen more decurved.</p>

<p>These peculiarities, which are constant, appear to indicate a decided or
strongly marked variety, as a series of almost a hundred specimens of
the northern bird from many localities exhibit none of the characters
mentioned, while all of an equally large series from Central America agree
in possessing them.</p>

<p>A series of Jalapan specimens from the cabinet of Mr. Lawrence show a
<!--630.png--><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 568]</span>
close relationship to skins from the Rio Grande, and do not approach the
Guatemalan bird in the peculiar characters just referred to, except in the
shortness and curvature of the bill. In one specimen there is an approach
to the Bogotan in a moderate degree of barring on the white inner edgings
of the tertials; in the rest, however, they are continuously white.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This handsome Woodpecker, distinguished both by the remarkable
beauty of its plumage and the peculiarity of its provident habits, has a
widely extended area of distribution, covering the Pacific Coast, from Oregon
throughout Mexico. In Central America it is replaced by the variety
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">striatipectus</i>, and in New Grenada by the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">flavigula</i>, while at Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Lucas we find another local form, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. angustifrons</i>. So far as we have the
means of ascertaining their habits, we find no mention of any essential differences
in this respect among these races.</p>

<p>Suckley and Cooper did not meet with this bird in Washington Territory,
and Mr. Lord met with it in abundance on his journey from Yreka to the
boundary line of British Columbia. Mr. Dresser did not observe it at San
Antonio. Mr. Clark met with it at the Coppermines, in New Mexico, in great
numbers, and feeding principally among the oaks. Lieutenant Couch found
it in the recesses of the Sierra Madre quite common and very tame, resorting
to high trees in search of its food. He did not meet with it east of the
Sierra Madre. Dr. Kennerly first observed it in the vicinity of Santa Cruz,
where it was very frequent on the mountain-slopes, always preferring the
tallest trees, but very shy, and it was with difficulty that a specimen
could be procured. Mr. Nuttall, who first added this bird to our fauna,
speaks of it as very plentiful in the forests around Santa Barbara. Between
that region and the Pueblo de los Angeles, Dr. Gambel met with it in great
abundance, although neither writer makes mention of any peculiarities of
habit. Mr. Emanuel Samuels met with it in and around Petaluma, where
he obtained the eggs.</p>

<p>Dr. Newberry, in his Report on the zoölogy of Lieutenant Williamson’s
route (<abbr title="Pacific Railroad Routes">P. R. R.</abbr> Reports, <abbr title="Six">VI</abbr>), states that the range of this species extends to
the Columbia, and perhaps above, to the westward of the Cascade Range,
though more common in California than in Oregon. It was not found in
the Des Chutes Basin, nor in the Cascade Mountains.</p>

<p>In the list of the birds of Guatemala given by Mr. Salvin in the Ibis, this
Woodpecker is mentioned (<abbr title="One, page">I, p.</abbr> 137) as being found in the Central Region,
at Calderas, on the Volcan de Fuego, in forests of evergreen oaks, where it
feeds on acorns.</p>

<p>Dr. Heermann describes it as among the noisiest as well as the most abundant
of the Woodpeckers of California. He speaks of it as catching insects
on the wing, after the manner of a Flycatcher, and mentions its very extraordinary
habit of digging small holes in the bark of the pine and the oak,
in which it stores acorns for its food in winter. He adds that one of these
acorns is placed in each hole, and is so tightly fitted or driven in that it is
<!--631.png--><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 569]</span>
with difficulty extracted. Thus, the bark of a large pine forty or fifty feet
high will present the appearance of being closely studded with brass nails,
the heads only being visible. These acorns are thus stored in large quantities,
and serve not only the Woodpecker, but trespassers as well. Dr. Heermann
speaks of the nest as being excavated in the body of the tree to a
depth varying from six inches to two feet, the eggs being four or five in
number, and pure white.</p>

<p>These very remarkable and, for a Woodpecker, somewhat anomalous
habits, first mentioned among American writers by Dr. Heermann, have
given rise to various conflicting statements and theories in regard to the
design of these collections of acorns. Some have even ventured to discredit
the facts, but these are too well authenticated to be questioned. Too many
naturalists whose accuracy cannot be doubted have been eyewitnesses to
these performances. Among these is Mr. J. K. Lord, who, however, was
constrained to confess his utter inability to explain why the birds did so.
He was never able to find an acorn that seemed to have been eaten, nor a
trace of vegetable matter in their stomachs, and at the close of his investigations
he frankly admitted this storing of acorns to be a mystery for which
he could offer no satisfactory explanation.</p>

<p>M. H. de Saussure, the Swiss naturalist, in an interesting paper published
in 1858 in the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bibliothèque Universelle</cite> of Geneva, furnishes some very
interesting observations on the habits of a Woodpecker, which he supposed
to be the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colaptes mexicanoides</i> of Mexico, of storing collections of acorns in
the hollow stems of the maguay plants. Sumichrast, who accompanied
Saussure in his excursion, while recognizing the entire truth of the interesting
facts he narrates, is confident that the credit of all this instinctive forethought
belongs not to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colaptes</i>, but to the Mexican race of this species.
Saussure’s article being too long to quote in full, we give an abstract.</p>

<p>The slopes of a volcanic mountain, Pizarro, near Perote, in Mexico, are
covered with immense beds of the maguay (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agave americana</i>), with larger
growths of yuccas, but without any other large shrubs or trees. Saussure
was surprised to find this silent and dismal wilderness swarming with
Woodpeckers. A circumstance so unusual as this large congregation of birds,
by nature so solitary, in a spot so unattractive, prompted him to investigate
the mystery. The birds were seen to fly first to the stalks of the
maguay, to attack them with their beaks, and then to pass to the yuccas,
and there repeat their labors. These stalks, upon examination, were all
found to be riddled with holes, placed irregularly one above another, and
communicating with the hollow cavity within. On cutting open one of
these stalks, he found it filled with acorns.</p>

<p>As is well known, this plant, after flowering, dies, its stalk remains, its outer
covering hardens into a flinty texture, and its centre becomes hollow. This
convenient cavity is used by the Woodpecker as a storehouse for provisions
that are unusual food for the tribe. The central cavity of the stalk is only
<!--632.png--><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 570]</span>
large enough to receive one acorn at a time. They are packed in, one above
the other, until the cavity is full. How did these Woodpeckers first learn
to thus use these storehouses, by nature closed against them? The intelligent
instinct that enabled this bird to solve this problem Saussure regarded
as not the least surprising feature. With its beak it pierces a small round
hole through the lower portion into the central cavity, and thrusts in acorns
until the hollow is filled to the level of the hole. It then makes a second
opening higher up, and fills the space below in a like manner, and so proceeds
until the entire stalk is full. Sometimes the space is too small to receive
the acorns, and they have to be forced in by blows from its beak. In
other stalks there are no cavities, and then the Woodpecker creates one for
each acorn, forcing it into the centre of the pith.</p>

<p>The labor necessary to enable the bird to accomplish all this is very considerable,
and great industry is required to collect its stores; but, once collected,
the storehouse is a very safe and convenient one. Mount Pizarro is
in the midst of a barren desert of sand and volcanic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i>. There are no
oak-trees nearer than the Cordilleras, thirty miles distant, and therefore the
collecting and storing of each acorn required a flight of sixty miles.</p>

<p>This, reasons Saussure, is obviously an instinctive preparation, on the
part of these birds, to provide the means of supporting life during the arid
winter months, when no rain falls and everything is parched. His observations
were made in April, the last of the winter months; and he found
the Woodpeckers withdrawing food from their depositories, and satisfied
himself that the birds were eating the acorn itself, and not the diminutive
maggots a few of them contained.</p>

<p>The ingenuity with which the bird managed to get at the contents of each
acorn was also quite striking. Its feet being unfit for grasping the acorn, it
digs a hole into the dry bark of the yuccas, just large enough to receive the
small end of the acorn, which it inserts, making use of its bill to split it
open, as with a wedge. The trunks of the yuccas were all found riddled
with these holes.</p>

<p>There are several remarkable features to be noticed in the facts observed
by Saussure,&mdash;the provident instinct which prompts this bird to lay by
stores of provisions for the winter; the great distance traversed to collect
a kind of food so unusual for its race; and its seeking, in a spot so remote
from its natural abode, a storehouse so remarkable. Can instinct alone
teach, or have experience and reason taught, these birds, that, better far than
the bark of trees, or cracks in rocks, or cavities dug in the earth, or any
other known hiding-place, are these hidden cavities within the hollow stems
of distant plants? What first taught them how to break through the flinty
coverings of these retreats? By what revelation could these birds have
been informed that within these dry and closed stalks they could, by searching,
find suitable places, protected from moisture, for preserving their stores
in a state most favorable for their long preservation, safe from gnawing
<!--633.png--><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 571]</span>
rats, and from those acorn-eating birds whose bills are not strong or sharp
enough to cut through their tough enclosures?

M. Sumichrast, who afterwards enjoyed unusual opportunities for observing
the habits of these Woodpeckers in the State of Vera Cruz, states that
they dwell exclusively in oak woods, and that near Potrero, as well as in
the alpine regions, trunks of oak-trees are found pierced with small holes in
circular lines around their circumference. Into each of these holes these
birds drive the acorns by repeated blows of their beaks, so as to fix them
firmly. At other times they make their collection of acorns in openings between
the raised bark of dry trees and the trunks. This writer states that
he has sought in vain to explain such performances satisfactorily. The
localities in which these birds reside, in Mexico, teem at all seasons with
insects; and it seems absurd, therefore, to suppose that they can be in quest
of the small, almost microscopic, larvæ contained in the acorns.</p>

<p>Dr. C. T. Jackson sought to account for these interesting performances on
the ingenious hypothesis that the acorns thus stored are always infested with
larvæ, and never sound ones; that they are driven into the tree cup-end foremost,
so as to securely imprison the maggot and prevent its escape, and thus
enable the Woodpecker to devour it at its leisure. This would argue a wonderful
degree of intelligence and forethought, on the part of the Woodpecker,
and more than it is entitled to; for the facts do not sustain this hypothesis.
The acorns are not put into the tree with the cup-end in, but invariably
the reverse, so far as we have noticed; and the acorns, so far from
being wormy, are, in nine cases out of ten, sound ones. Besides, this theory
affords no explanation of the large collections of loose acorns made by these
birds in hollow trees, or in the stalks of the maguay plants. Nor can we
understand why, if so intelligent, they make so little use of these acorns, as
seems to be the almost universal testimony of California naturalists. And,
as still further demonstrating the incorrectness of this hypothesis, we have
recently been informed by Dr. Canfield of Monterey, <abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>, that occasionally
these Woodpeckers, following an instinct so blind that they do not distinguish
between an acorn and a pebble, are known to fill up the holes they
have drilled with so much labor, not only with acorns, but occasionally with
stones. In time the bark and the wood grow over these, and after a few
years they are left a long way from the surface. These trees are usually the
sugar-pine of California, a wood much used for lumber. Occasionally one
of these trees is cut, the log taken to mill without its being known that it is
thus charged with rounded pieces of flint or agate, and the saws that come
in contact with them are broken.</p>

<p>Without venturing to present an explanation of facts that have appeared
so contradictory and unsatisfactory to other naturalists, such as we can claim
to be either comprehensive or entirely satisfactory, we cannot discredit the
positive averments of such observers as Saussure and Salvin. We believe
that these Woodpeckers do eat the acorns, when they can do no better.
<!--634.png--><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 572]</span>
And when we are confronted with the fact, which we do not feel at liberty
to altogether disregard, that in very large regions this bird seems to labor in
vain, and makes no use of the treasures it has thus heaped together, we
can only attempt an explanation. This Woodpecker is found over an immense
area. It everywhere has the same instinctive promptings to provide,
not “for a rainy day,” but for the exact opposite,&mdash;for a long interval
during which no rain falls, for nearly two hundred days at a time, in all the
low and hot lands of Mexico and Central America. There these accumulations
become a necessity, there we are informed they do eat the acorns, and,
more than this, many other birds and beasts derive the means of self-preservation
in times of famine from the provident labors of this bird. That in
Oregon, in California, and in the mountains of Mexico and elsewhere,
where better and more natural food offers throughout the year, it is rarely
known to eat the acorns it has thus labored to save, only seems to prove that
it acts under the influences of an undiscriminating instinct that prompts it
to gather in its stores whether it needs them or not.</p>

<p>It may be, too, that writers have too hastily inferred that these birds never
eat the acorns, because they have been unable to obtain complete evidence
of the fact. We have recently received from C. W. Plass, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, some interesting
facts, which, if they do not prove that these birds in the winter visit
their stores and eat their acorns, render it highly probable. Mr. Plass resides
near Napa City, <abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>, near which city, and on the edge of the pine
forests, he has recently constructed a house. The gable-ends of this dwelling
the California Woodpeckers have found a very convenient storehouse for
their acorns, and Mr. Plass has very considerately permitted them to do so
unmolested. The window in the gable slides up upon pullies its whole
length, to admit of a passage to the upper verandah, and the open space in
the wall admits of the nuts falling down into the upper hall, and this frequently
happens when the birds attempt to extricate them from the outside.
Nearly all these nuts are found to be sound, and contain no worm, while
those that fall outside are empty shells. Empty shells have also been
noticed by Mr. Plass under the trees, indicating that the acorns have been
eaten.</p>

<p>The Smithsonian Institution has received specimens of the American race
of this Woodpecker, collected at Belize by Dr. Berendt, and accompanied
by illustrations of their work in the way of implantation of acorns in the
bark of trees.</p>

<p>The eggs of this Woodpecker, obtained by Mr. Emanuel Samuels near
Petaluma, <abbr title="California">Cal.</abbr>, and now in the collection of the Boston Society of Natural
History, are undistinguishable from the eggs of other Woodpeckers in form
or color, except that they are somewhat oblong, and measure 1.12 inches in
length by .90 of an inch in breadth.</p>

Compared with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. formicivorus</i>, the size is smaller. The light frontal bar is
much narrower; in the female scarcely more than half the black one behind it, and not
reaching anything like as far back as the anterior border of the eye, instead of exceeding
this limit. The light frontal and the black bars together are only about two thirds the
length of the occipital red, instead of exceeding it in length; the red patch reaches forward
nearly or quite to the posterior border of the eye, instead of falling a considerable
distance behind it, and being much broader posteriorly. The frontal band too is gamboge-yellow,
much like the throat, and not white; the connection with the yellow throat-patch
much broader. The white upper tail-coverts show a tendency to a black edge. Length,
8.00; wing, 5.20; tail, 3.20.</p>

All of eastern North America to the eastern slopes of Rocky Mountains;
farther north, extending across along the Yukon as far at least as Nulato, perhaps to
the Pacific. Greenland (<span class="sc">Reinhardt</span>). Localities: San Antonio, Texas, only one specimen
(<span class="sc">Dresser</span>, Ibis, 1865, 470).</p>

<p>Specimens vary considerably in size and proportions; the more northern
ones are much the larger. The spots vary in number and in size; they
may be circular, or transversely or longitudinally oval. Western specimens
appear paler. In a Selkirk Settlement specimen the belly is tinged with
pale sulphur-yellow, the back with olivaceous-green.</p>

<p>This species, in general pattern of coloration, resembles the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. mexicanus</i>,
although the colors are very different. Thus the shafts of the quills, with
their under surfaces, are gamboge-yellow, instead of orange-red. There is a
conspicuous nuchal crescent of crimson wanting, or but slightly indicated, in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mexicanus</i>. The cheek-patch is pure black, widening and abruptly truncate
behind, instead of bright crimson, pointed or rounded behind. The shade
of the upper parts is olivaceous-green, instead of purplish-brown. The top
of the head and the nape are more ashy. The chin, throat, neck, and sides of
the head, are pale purplish or lilac brown, instead of bluish-ash; the space
above, below, and around the eye of the same color, instead of having
reddish-brown above and ashy below.</p>

<p>The young of this species is sufficiently like the adult to be readily recognizable.
Sometimes the entire crown is faintly tipped with red, as characteristic
of young Woodpeckers.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> The Golden-winged Woodpecker is altogether the most common
and the most widely distributed of the North American representatives
of the genus. According to Sir John Richardson, it visits the fur
countries in the summer, extending its migrations as far to the north as the
Great Slave Lake, and resorting in great numbers to the plains of the Saskatchewan.
It was found by Dr. Woodhouse very abundant in Texas and
the Indian Territory, and it is given by Reinhardt as occurring in Greenland.
Mr. McFarlane found it breeding at Fort Anderson; Mr. Ross at Fort Rae,
Fort Resolution, and Fort Simpson; and Mr. Kennicott at Fort Yukon. All
this testimony demonstrates a distribution throughout the entire eastern
portion of North America, from the Gulf of Mexico almost to the Arctic
Ocean, and from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>In the more northern portions of the continent this bird is only a summer
visitant, but in the Southern and Middle, and to some extent in the
New England States, it is a permanent resident. Wilson speaks of seeing
them exposed for sale in the markets of Philadelphia during each month of
a very rigorous winter. Wilson’s observations of their habits during breeding,
made in Pennsylvania, were that early in April they begin to prepare
their nest. This is built in the hollow body or branch of a tree, sometimes,
<!--641.png--><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 577]</span>
though not always, at a considerable height from the ground. He adds that
he has frequently known them to fix on the trunk of an old apple-tree, at a
height not more than six feet from the root. He also mentions as quite surprising
the sagacity of this bird in discovering, under a sound bark, a hollow
limb or trunk of a tree, and its perseverance in perforating it for purposes of
incubation. The male and female alternately relieve and encourage each other
by mutual caresses, renewing their labors for several days, till the object is
attained, and the place rendered sufficiently capacious, convenient, and secure.
They are often so extremely intent upon their work as to be heard at their
labor till a very late hour in the night. Wilson mentions one instance where
he knew a pair to dig first five inches straight forward, and then downward
more than twice that distance, into a solid black-oak. They carry in no
materials for their nest, the soft chips and dust of the wood serving for this
purpose. The female lays six white eggs, almost transparent, very thick at the
greater end, and tapering suddenly to the other. The young soon leave the
nest, climbing to the higher branches, where they are fed by their parents.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Audubon this Woodpecker rears two broods in a season,
the usual number of eggs being six. In one instance, however, Mr. MacCulloch,
quoted by Audubon, speaks of having found a nest in a rotten stump,
which contained no less than eighteen young birds, of various ages, and at
least two eggs not quite hatched. It is not improbable that, in cases where
the number of eggs exceeds seven or eight, more females than one have contributed
to the number. In one instance, upon sawing off the decayed top
of an old tree, in which these birds had a nest, twelve eggs were found.
These were not molested, but, on visiting the place a few days after, I found
the excavation to have been deepened from eighteen to twenty-four inches.</p>

<p>Mr. C. S. Paine, of Randolph, <abbr title="Vermont">Vt.</abbr>, writing in October, 1860, furnishes some
interesting observations made in regard to these birds in the central part of
that State. He says, “This Woodpecker is very common, and makes its appearance
about the 20th of April. Between the 1st and the 15th of May it
usually commences boring a hole for the nest, and deposits its eggs the last
of May or the first of June.” He found three nests that year, all of which
were in old stumps on the banks of a small stream. Each nest contained
<em>seven</em> eggs. The boy who took them out was able to do so without any cutting,
and found them at the depth of his elbow. In another nest there were
but three eggs when first discovered. The limb was cut down nearly to a
level with the eggs, which were taken. The next day the nest had been
deepened a whole foot and another egg deposited. Mr. Paine has never
known them go into thick woods to breed, but they seem rather to prefer
the edges of woods. He has never known one to breed in an old cavity,
but in one instance a pair selected a partially decayed stump for their operations.
When they are disturbed, they sometimes fly around their nests, uttering
shrill, squeaking notes, occasionally intermixing with them guttural or
gurgling tones.</p>

<p><!--642.png--><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 578]</span>
It is probably true that they usually excavate their own burrow, but this
is not an invariable rule. In the fall of 1870 a pair of these Woodpeckers
took shelter in my barn, remaining there during the winter. Although there
were abundant means of entrance and of egress, they wrought for themselves
other passages out and in through the most solid part of the sides of the
building. Early in the spring they took possession of a large cavity in an
old apple-tree, directly on the path between the barn and the house, where
they reared their family. They were very shy, and rarely permitted themselves
to be seen. The nest contained six young, each of which had been
hatched at successive intervals, leaving the nest one after the other. The
youngest was nearly a fortnight later to depart than the first. Just before
leaving the nest, the oldest bird climbed to the opening of the cavity, filling
the whole space, and uttering a loud hissing sound whenever the nest was
approached. As soon as they could use their wings, even partially, they
were removed, one by one, to a more retired part of the grounds, where they
were fed by their parents.</p>

<p>Throughout Massachusetts, this bird, generally known as the Pigeon
Woodpecker, is one of the most common and familiar birds. They abound
in old orchards and groves, and manifest more apparent confidence in man
than the treatment they receive at his hands seems to justify. Their nests
are usually constructed at the distance of only a few feet from the ground,
and though Wilson, Audubon, and Nuttall agree upon six as the average
of their eggs, they frequently exceed this number. Mr. Audubon gives as
the measurement of the eggs of this species 1.08 inches in length and .88
of an inch in breadth. Their length varies from 1.05 to 1.15 inches, and
their breadth from .91 to .85 of an inch. Their average measurement
is 1.09 by .88 of an inch.</p>

Western North America from
Pacific to the Black Hills; north to
Sitka on the coast. Localities:
Oaxaca (<abbr title="Sclater Proceedings Zoölogical Society"><span class="sc">Scl.</span> P. Z. S.</abbr> 1858, 305);
Vera Cruz, alpine regions (<span class="sc">Sumichrast</span>,

1866, 56).</p>


<p>The female is similar in every
way, perhaps a little smaller, but lacks the red mustache. This is, however,
indicated by a brown tinge over an area corresponding with that of the red
of the male.</p>

<p>In the present specimen (1,886) there is a slight indication of an interrupted
nuchal red band, as in the common Flicker, in some crimson fibres
to some of the feathers about as far behind the eye as this is from the bill.
A large proportion of males before us exhibit the same characteristic, some
more, some less, although it generally requires careful examination for its
detection. It may possibly be a characteristic of the not fully mature bird,
although it occurs in two out of three male specimens.</p>

<p>There is a little variation in the size of the pectoral crescent and spots;
the latter are sometimes rounded or oblong cordate, instead of circular.
The bill varies as much as three or four tenths of an inch. The rump,
usually immaculate, sometimes has a few black streaks. The extent of the
red whisker varies a little. In skins from Oregon and Washington the color
of the back is as described; in those from California and New Mexico it is
of a grayer cast. There is little, if any, variation in the shade of red in the
whiskers and quill-feathers. The head is washed on the forehead with
rufous, passing into ashy on the nape.</p>

<p>There is not only some difference in the size of this species, in the same
locality, but, as a general rule, the more southern specimens are smaller.</p>

<p>This species is distinct from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. mexicanoides</i> of Lafresnaye, though
somewhat resembling it. It is, however, a smaller bird; the red of the
cheeks is deeper; the whole upper part of the head and neck uniform reddish-cinnamon
without any ash, in marked contrast to that on the sides of the
<!--644.png--><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 580]</span>
head. The back is strongly glossed with reddish-brown, and the black
transverse bars are much more distinct, closer and broader, three or four on
each feather, instead of two only. The rump and upper tail-coverts are
closely barred, the centre of the former only clearer white, but even here
each feather has a cordate spot of white. The spots on the flanks posteriorly
exhibit a tendency to become transverse bars.</p>

<p>Specimens from Mount Orizaba, Mexico, are very similar to those from
Oregon in color, presenting no appreciable difference. The size is, however,
much less, a male measuring 10.50, wing 6.00, tail 4.60 inches, instead of
12.75, 6.75, and 5.25 respectively. While, however, the feet are smaller
(tarsus 1.00 instead of 1.15), the bill is fully as large, or even larger.</p>

<p>Most young birds of this species have a tinge of red on top of the head,
and frequently a decided nuchal crescent of red; but these are only embryonic
features, and disappear with maturity.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This species, the counterpart in so many respects of the Golden-winged
Woodpecker, appears to take the place of that species from the slopes
of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, throughout western North America.
Dr. Woodhouse speaks of finding it abundant along the banks of the Rio
Grande. And in the fine collection belonging to the Smithsonian Institution
are specimens from the Straits of Fuca, Fort Steilacoom, and Fort Vancouver,
in Washington Territory, from the Columbia River, from various
points in California, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, Texas,
Mexico, etc. Dr. Gambel, in his Paper on the birds of California, first met
with the Red-shafted Woodpecker soon after leaving New Mexico, and it
continued to California, where he found it very abundant. He describes it
as a remarkably shy bird, and adds that he always saw it on the margins of
small creeks, where nothing grew larger than a willow-bush. Dr. Heermann
also found it abundant in California. Dr. Newberry, in his Report on the
zoölogy of Lieutenant Williamson’s expedition, speaks of the Red-shafted
Flicker as rather a common bird in all parts of California and Oregon which
his party visited. He describes many of its habits as identical with those of
the Golden Flicker (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. auratus</i>), but regards it as much the shyer bird. Dr.
Cooper also mentions the fact of the great abundance of this bird along the
western coast, equalling that of its closely allied cousin on the eastern side
of the Mississippi. It also resembles, he adds, that bird so exactly in
habits and notes that the description of one will apply with exactness to the
other. It is a constant resident in Washington Territory, or at least west
of the Cascade Mountains. He observed it already burrowing out holes
for its nests in April, at the Straits of Fuca. About June 1 he found a
nest containing seven young, nearly fledged, which already showed in the
male the distinguishing red mustache. Dr. Suckley, in the same report,
also says that it is extremely common in the timbered districts of Washington
Territory, and adds that its habits, voice, calls, etc., are precisely similar
to those of the Yellow-Hammer of the Eastern States. Mr. Nuttall, as
<!--645.png--><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 581]</span>
quoted by Mr. Audubon, states that he first came upon this bird in the narrow
belt of forest which borders Laramie’s Fork of the Platte, and adds
that he scarcely lost sight of it from that time until he reached the shores
of the Pacific. Its manners, in all respects, are so entirely similar to those
of the common species that the same description applies to both. He also
regards it as the shyer bird of the two, and less frequently seen on the
ground. They burrow in the oak and pine trees, and lay white eggs, after
the manner of the whole family, and these eggs are in no wise distinguishable
from those of the Golden-wing.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper, in his Report upon the birds of California, refers to this as a
common species, and found in every part of the State except the bare plains.
It even frequents the low bushes, where no trees are to be seen for miles.
In the middle wooded districts, and towards the north, it is much more
abundant than elsewhere.</p>

<p>Their nesting-holes are at all heights from the ground, and are usually
about one foot in depth. In the southern part of the State their eggs are
laid in April, but farther north, at the Columbia, in May.</p>

<p>Dr. Cooper attributes their shyness in certain localities to their being
hunted so much by the Indians for their bright feathers. Generally he
found them quite tame, so that their interesting habits may be watched
without difficulty. He regards them as an exact counterpart of the eastern
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auratus</i>, living largely on insects and ants, which they collect without much
trouble, and do not depend upon hard work, like other Woodpeckers, for their
food. During the season they also feed largely on berries. Their curved
bill is not well adapted for hammering sound wood for insects, and they only
dig into decayed trees in search of their food. Like the eastern species, the
young of these birds, when their nest is approached, make a curious hissing
noise. They may be seen chasing each other round the trunk of trees, as
if in sport, uttering, at the same time, loud cries like <i class="birdcall">whittoo, whittoo, whittoo</i>.
Dr. Kennerly found these birds from the Big Sandy to the Great Colorado,
but they were so shy that he could not obtain a specimen. They were seen
on the barren hills among the large cacti, in which they nest. Their extreme
shyness was fully explained afterwards by finding how closely they are
hunted by the Indians for the sake of their feathers, of which head-dresses
are made.</p>

<p>Mr. Dresser states that this bird is found as far east as San Antonio, where,
however, it is of uncommon occurrence. In December he noticed several
near the Nueces River, and in February and March obtained others near
Piedras Negras.</p>

<p>Dr. Coues gives it as abundant and resident in Arizona, where it is found
in all situations. Its tongue, he states, is capable of protrusion to an extent
far beyond that of any other North American Woodpecker.</p>

<p>This bird, in some parts of California, is known as the Yellow-Hammer, a
name given in some parts of New England to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colaptes auratus</i>. Mr.
<!--646.png--><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 582]</span>
C. W. Plass, of Napa City, writes me that this Woodpecker “makes himself
too much at home with us to be agreeable. He drills large holes though the
weather-boards of the house, and shelters himself at night between them and
the inner wall. He does, not nest there, but simply makes of such situations
his winter home. We have had to shoot them, for we find it is of no use to
shut up one hole, as they will at once make another by its side.”</p>

<p>Mr. J. A. Allen mentions finding this species, in the absence of suitable
trees on the Plains, making excavations in sand-banks.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Ridgway, the Red-shafted Flicker does not differ from
the Yellow-shafted species of the east in the slightest particular, as regards
habits, manners, and notes. It is, however, more shy than the eastern species,
probably from the fact that it is pursued by the Indians, who prize its
quill and tail-feathers as ornaments with which to adorn their dress.</p>

<p>Their eggs are hardly distinguishable from those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auratus</i>, but range
of a very slightly superior size. They average 1.12 inches in length by .89
of an inch in breadth. Their greatest length is 1.15 inches, their least 1.10,
and their breadth ranges from .87 to .90.</p>

<p>The general distribution of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Colaptes mexicanus</i>, as already indicated, is
from the Pacific coast of the United States, eastward to the Black Hills and
the Upper Missouri and Yellowstone; that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. auratus</i> from the Atlantic
Coast to about the eastern limits of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mexicanus</i>. But little variation
is seen in the two species up to the region mentioned; slight differences in
shade of color, size, and frequency of spots, etc., being all. Where they
come together, however, or overlap, a most remarkable race is seen, in which
no two specimens, nay, scarcely the two sides of the same bird, are alike,
the characters of the two species becoming mixed up in the most extraordinary
manner. Thus, the shafts show every shade from orange-red to pure
yellow; yellow shafts combine with red cheek-patch (as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. ayresii</i> of Audubon);
a red nape, with orange-red shafts; cheek-patches red with black
feathers intermixed, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>; perhaps the feathers red at base and black
<!--647.png--><!--Plate 55-->
<!--648.png--><!--blank page-->
<!--649.png--><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 583]</span>
at tip, or black at base and red at tip, etc. As the subject has been presented
in sufficient detail in the Birds of North America, as quoted above,
it need not be repeated here, except to say that collections received since
1858 only substantiate what has there been stated.</p>

<p>To the race thus noted, the name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hybridus</i> was given, not as of a variety,
since it is not entitled to this rank, but as of a heterogeneous mixture, caused
by the breeding together of two different species, and requiring some appellation.
Whether the presumed hybrids are fertile, and breed with each other or
with full-blooded parents, has not yet been ascertained; perhaps not, since
the area in which they occur is limited, and it is only occasionally that
individuals of the kind referred to have been found beyond the bounds mentioned.
It is very rarely, however, that pure breeds occur in the district of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hybridus</i>, a taint being generally appreciable in all.</p>

<p>The conditions in the present instance appear different from those adverted
to under the head of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Picus villosus</i>, where the question is not one of hybridism
between two strongly marked and distinct species, but of the gradual change,
between the Atlantic and the Pacific, from one pattern of coloration to another.</p>

throat, and sides of head ash-gray. Shafts of quills and tail-feathers, with their under
surfaces in great part, gamboge-yellow; no nuchal red. Malar patch of male red; wanting

<p>This interesting species is intermediate between <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auratus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mexicanus</i> in
having the yellow shafts and quills of the former; a red malar patch, an
ashy throat, and no nuchal crescent, as in the latter. To <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mexicanoides</i> the
relationship is still closer, since both have the rufous-brown head above. A
hybrid between this last species and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auratus</i> would in some varieties come
very near <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chrysoides</i>, but as it does not belong to the region of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chrysoides</i>,
and there is no transition from one species to the other in any specimens, as
in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hybridus</i>, there is no occasion to take this view of the species.</p>

<p>Cape <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas specimens, where the species is exceedingly abundant, are
considerably smaller than those from Arizona, and appear to be more strongly
<!--650.png--><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 584]</span>
marked with black above and below; otherwise there seems to be no difference
of special importance.</p>

<p>As neither <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. auratus</i> nor <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mexicanus</i> has the top of the head rufous-brown,
(though slightly indicated anteriorly in the latter), this character has not
been noted in the hybrids between the two (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hybridus</i>), and its presence in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chrysoides</i> will serve to distinguish it from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hybridus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> This comparatively new form of Woodpecker was first described
in 1852 by Malherbe, from a California specimen in the Paris
Museum, which had been at first supposed to be a female or immature
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ayresii</i>. What Dr. Cooper thinks may have been this species was met with
by Dr. Heermann among the mountains bordering upon the Cosumnes
River, in California, where it was rare, and only two specimens were taken.
In February, 1861, other specimens of this bird were taken at Fort Mohave
by Dr. Cooper. They were feeding on larvæ and insects among the poplar-trees,
and were very shy and wary. The bird is supposed to winter in the
Colorado Valley, and wherever found has been met with in valleys, and not
on mountains. It is an abundant and characteristic member of the Cape
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lucas fauna.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Cooper these birds were already mated at Fort Mohave
after February 20. They had the same habits, flight, and cries as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C.

<p class="small"><abbr title="Habitat"><span class="sc">Hab.</span></abbr>
Southern and Southwestern
States and Mississippi Valley; north to
the Great Lakes and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>This species was once very
abundant in the United States
east of the Rocky Mountains, being
known throughout the Southern
States, and the entire valley of the Mississippi, north to the Great
Lakes. Stragglers even penetrated to Pennsylvania, and one case of their
reaching Albany, <abbr title="New York"><span class="sc">N. Y.</span></abbr>, is on record. Now, however, they are greatly
restricted. In Florida they are yet abundant, but, according to Dr. Coues,
they are scarcely entitled to a place in the fauna of South Carolina. In
Western Louisiana, Arkansas, and the Indian Territory, they are still found
in considerable numbers, straggling over the adjacent States, but now seldom
<!--656.png--><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 588]</span>
go north of the mouth of the Ohio. We have seen no note of their occurrence
south of the United States, and in view of their very limited area and
rapid diminution in numbers, there is little doubt but that their total extinction
is only a matter of years, perhaps to be consummated within the lifetime
of persons now living. It is a question whether both sexes are similarly colored,
as in most American Parrots, or whether the female, as just stated,
lacks the yellow of the head. Several female birds killed in Florida in
March agree in the characters indicated above for that sex; but the material
at our command is not sufficient to decide whether all females are similarly
marked, or whether the plumage described is that of the bird of the second
year generally. There is no trace whatever of yellow on the head.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Habits.</span> In determining the geographical distribution of the Carolina
Parrot, a distinction should be made between its accidental occurrence and
its usual and habitual residence. Strictly speaking, this species, though of
roving habits, is not migratory. Its movements are irregular, and dependent
upon the abundance or the scarcity of its food. Where it breeds, it is usually
a permanent resident. An exceptional visit to a place cannot be taken
as certain evidence that it will reappear in that locality.</p>

<p>When Wilson wrote, it inhabited the interior of Louisiana and the country
lying upon the banks of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, and their tributary
waters, even beyond the Illinois River, to the neighborhood of Lake Michigan,
in latitude 42<abbr title="degrees">°</abbr> north. The same writer insisted that, contrary to the
generally received opinion, it was at that time resident in all those places.
Eastward of the great range of the Alleghanies it has been very seldom seen
north of the State of Maryland, though straggling parties have been occasionally
observed among the valleys of the Juniata. Barton states that a
very large flock of these birds was observed in January, 1780, about twenty-five
miles northwest of Albany.</p>

<p>The occurrence of this species in midwinter so far to the north, and its
constant residence west of the Alleghanies throughout the year in colder
regions, justify the conclusion of its being a very hardy bird. In evidence
of this, Wilson mentions the fact of his having seen a number of them, in
the month of February, on the banks of the Ohio, in a snow-storm, flying
about like Pigeons, and in full cry.</p>

<p>The very evident preference which the Carolina Parakeet evinces for western
localities, though in the same parallel of latitude with those east of the
Alleghanies, which it rarely or never visits, is attributed by the same attentive
observer to certain peculiar features of the country to which it is particularly
and strongly attached. These are the low, rich alluvial bottoms
along the borders of creeks, covered with a gigantic growth of buttonwood,
deep and impenetrable swamps of the cypress, and those peculiar salines&mdash;or,
as they are called, salt-licks&mdash;so frequent throughout that region, all of
which are regularly visited by the Parakeets. The great abundance of the
seeds of the cockle-bur (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Xanthium strumarium</i>) is also given as a still greater
<!--657.png--><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 589]</span>
inducement for their frequenting the banks of the Ohio and the Mississippi,
where these plants are found in the greatest abundance. The seeds of the
cypress-trees are another powerful attraction, while the abundance of the
mast of the beech, on which it feeds freely, may explain their occasional
visits to more northern regions, and even to places where they were before
unknown.</p>

<p>In descending the Ohio in the month of February, Wilson met the first
flock of Parakeets at the mouth of the Little Scioto. He was informed by
an old inhabitant of Marietta that they were sometimes, though rarely, seen
there. He afterwards observed flocks of them at the mouth of the Great
and Little Miami, and in the neighborhood of the numerous creeks which
discharge themselves into the Ohio. At Big Bone Lick, near the mouth of
the Kentucky River, he met them in great numbers. They came screaming
through the woods, about an hour after sunrise, to drink the salt water, of
which, he says, they are remarkably fond.</p>

<p>Audubon, writing in 1842, speaks of the Parakeets as then very rapidly
diminishing in number. In some regions where twenty-five years before
they had been very plentiful, at that time scarcely any were to be seen. At
one period, he adds, they could be procured as far up the tributary water of
the Ohio as the Great Kanawha, the Scioto, the head of the Miami, the
mouth of the Maumee at its junction with Lake Erie, and sometimes as far
northeast as Lake Ontario. At the time of his writing very few were to be
found higher than Cincinnati, and he estimated that along the Mississippi
there was not half the number that had existed there fifteen years before.</p>

<p>According to Nuttall, this species constantly inhabits and breeds in the
Southern States, and is so hardy as to make its appearance commonly, in the
depth of winter, along the wooded banks of the Ohio, the interior of Alabama,
and the banks of the Mississippi and Missouri, around <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, and
other places, when nearly all the other birds have migrated.</p>

<p>Its present habitat seems to be the Southern and Southwestern States, as
far west as the Missouri. They occur high up that river, although none were
seen or collected much farther west than its banks. In the enumeration of
the localities from which the specimens in the Smithsonian collection were
derived, Florida, Cairo, <abbr title="Illinois">Ill.</abbr>, Fort Smith, Arkansas, Fort Riley, Kansas, Nebraska,
and Bald Island, Missouri River, and Michigan are given.</p>

<p>In regard to the manner of nesting, breeding-habits, number of eggs in a
nest, and the localities in which it breeds, I know nothing from my own
personal observations, nor are writers generally better informed, with the
single exception of Mr. Audubon. Wilson states that all his informants
agreed that these birds breed in hollow trees. Several affirmed to him that
they had seen their nests. Some described these as made with the use of no
additional materials, others spoke of their employing certain substances to
line the hollows they occupied. Some represented the eggs as white, others
as speckled. One man assured him that in the hollow of a large beech-tree,
<!--658.png--><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590"></a><span class="pagenum">[Pg 590]</span>
which he had cut down, he found the broken fragments of upwards of
twenty Parakeet’s eggs, which he described as of a greenish-yellow color. He
described the nest as formed of small twigs glued to each other and to the
side of the tree in the manner of the Chimney-Swallow! From all these
contradictory accounts Wilson was only able to gather, with certainty, that
they build in companies and in hollow trees. The numerous dissections
which he made in the months of March, April, May, and June led him to
infer that they commence incubation late in spring or very early in summer.</p>

<p>Mr. Audubon, who speaks from his own observations, describes their nests,
or the places in which they deposit their eggs, as simply the bottom of such
cavities in trees as those to which they usually retire at night. Many
females, he thinks, deposit their eggs together; and he expresses the opinion
that the number of eggs which each individual lays is two, although he
was not able absolutely to assure himself of this. He describes them as
nearly round, and of a light greenish-white. An egg of this species from
Louisiana is of a rounded oval shape, equally obtuse at either end, and of a
uniform dull-white color. It measures 1.40 by 1.10 inches.</p>

     Superciliary stripe pure light ash, becoming white anterior to
     the eye; two broad, dark-brown stripes on side of head,&mdash;one
     from the eye back along upper edge of auriculars, the other back
     from the rictus, along their lower border. Lower parts pure
     white, the flanks and crissum distinctly ochraceous; markings
     beneath broad and heavy, entirely pure deep black; those on the
     jugulum deltoid, on the sides linear. Wing, 2.60; tail, 2.85;
     bill, .37 and .24; tarsus, .85; middle toe without claw, .68.
     This may possibly be the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">M. pectoralis</i> of von Müller. The
     description cited above, however, does not agree with the
     specimen under consideration. The pectoral spots are expressly
     stated to be brown, not even a black shaft-streak being
     mentioned, whereas the pure black spots of the specimen before us
     render it peculiar in this respect, being, in fact, its chief
     characteristic.</p>

     original type, the large collection before us vindicates the
     action of those who have referred the California species to that
     described by Swainson as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscus</i>, and who have
     distinguished the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. mesoleucus</i> from both. The original
     description of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscus</i> agrees almost exactly with
     <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crissalis</i>, both actually scarcely separable; while the
     <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mesoleucus</i>, intermediate in geographical position, is
     decidedly different from either. The relationships of these
     different forms will be found expressed in the general diagnosis
     already given.</p>

     <p class="footnote">Two descriptions given by Swainson, copied
     below, of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. fuscus</i>, differ somewhat from each other,
     and may not have been taken from the same specimen. The
     identification of either with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. mesoleucus</i> would be a
     difficult matter; while the first one expresses the peculiar
     characters of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crissalis</i> more nearly than any other. The
     statement of “white beneath,” without any qualification, applies
     better to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mesoleucus</i> than to others, but the “pale rufous
     tinge” observable in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crissalis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuscus</i> is very
     different from the abruptly defined chestnut cap of

     It is an interesting fact in regard to the species of
     <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Icteridæ</i>, that, as a general rule, female birds of West
     Indian representatives of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agelainæ</i> and
     <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quiscalinæ</i> are usually, or perhaps universally, uniformly
     black, where the continental are brown, either concolored or
     streaked. We know of no exception to the first part of this
     statement as to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agelaius</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nesopsar</i>,
     <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scolecophagus</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quiscalus</i>. The smaller North
     American species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quiscalus</i> have the females duller, but
     not otherwise very different from the males, except in size. The
     females of the large <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quiscalus</i>, all continental, are much
     smaller than the males, and totally different. In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Icterus</i>
     all the species in which the female is very different in color
     from the male are Northern Mexican or continental North American
     (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pustulatus</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">spurius</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">baltimore</i>,
     <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bullocki</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cucullatus</i>, etc.). Most West Indian
     <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Icterus</i> also exhibit no difference in the sexes,
     <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominicensis</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hypomelas</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">xanthomus</i>,
     <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonanæ</i>, etc.; in one alone (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">leucopteryx</i>) is the
     difference appreciable. The South American species have the
     females pretty generally similar to the males, but smaller, as is
     the case in the entire family.</p>

     species appears to be an abundant bird from Northern Mexico
     throughout that republic and Central America to Costa Rica. I am
     not aware that any specimens have been procured actually within
     our territory. It was met with at Saltillo, in the state of
     Coahuila, Mexico, by Lieutenant Couch, where only a single
     specimen was obtained. It was taken at the rancho of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ojo
     Caliente</i>, or Hot Springs. It was quite shy and difficult of
     approach. Like all the other Orioles, it appeared to be quite
     fond of the palm-tree known as the Spanish bayonet. It is given
     by Sumichrast as occurring in the department of Vera Cruz, where
     it appears to be confined to the hot region. It is quite common
     in the district of Cordova, to the height of about three thousand
     feet.</p>

     <p class="footnote">Mr. Salvin states this to be the only
     <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Icterus</i> found by him about Dueñas, where it was not
     uncommon. In a letter written by this naturalist, published in
     the Ibis of October, 1859, he mentions having taken the nest and
     eggs of this species. The structure, though of the same
     character,&mdash;a hanging nest,&mdash;is very different from
     that of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">I. gularis</i>, the common species on the Yzabal road.
     The nest has none of the depth of the other, but is comparatively
     shallow.</p>

     A series of twenty-nine specimens of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Q. purpureus</i> from
     Florida, has been kindly furnished for examination by Mr. C. J.
     Maynard, chiefly from the northern and middle portions of the
     State, and consequently intermediate between the varieties
     <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aglæus</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">purpureus</i>. In color, however, they are
     nearly all essentially, most of them typically, like the former;
     but in size and proportions they scarcely differ from more
     northern specimens of the latter. Their common and nearly
     constant features of coloration are, uniform soft dark greenish
     body, with blue tinge on belly, and bluish-green tail-coverts and
     tail, violet head, more blue anteriorly and more bronzy on the
     foreneck, and with this color abruptly defined posteriorly
     against the peculiar uniform blackish dull green of the body; the
     wing-coverts usually tipped with vivid violet and green spots.
     One male is a typical example of the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">purpureus</i>,
     distinguished by the blending of the similar metallic tints on
     the body and head, the broken tints on the body arranged in
     transverse bars on the back, more purple tail-coverts, and lack
     of the vivid metallic tips to the wing-coverts. There are also
     four nearly typical specimens of the <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aglæus</i>, these
     probably from farther south on the peninsula, but with the
     characteristics of the race less exaggerated than in the types
     from the keys. The measurements of this series are as
     follows:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

     better to show the great distinction to be made between this

     melanism, the lighter markings on the wings becoming greatly
     restricted; there is still, however, a decided presence of white
     on the lower tail-coverts. Specimens from Costa Rica (typical
     <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aquaticus</i>) exhibit the maximum degree of melanism, the
     white beneath being confined to a central spot on the abdomen. In

     These measurements are not only those of United States and

     (“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sordidulus</i>,” <span class="sc">Sclater</span>, and
     “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">plebeius</i>,” <span class="sc">Cabanis</span>), and of a

     Island, Guayaquil) is founded upon an immature specimen, so the
     characters of the species cannot be given with exactness. The
     relationship appears very close to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">C. caribæus</i>, there
     being the same large, very depressed bill, with the long bristles
     reaching nearly to its tip, and the tail about as long as the
     wing; while the upper plumage has the light faint transverse
     mottling seen in the young <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caribæus</i>, <abbr title="variation">var.</abbr>
     <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bahamensis</i>, and the lining of the wing ochraceous. In
     colors, however, the two are very different, the young of
     <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">punensis</i> being ashy-green, instead of pure ash, on the
     back, the crown very much darker, instead of not appreciably so;
     the wing-bands are white instead of ochraceous, while the breast
     and sides are dull sulphur-yellowish, instead of ashy, without
     any yellow tinge. The measurements are as follows: Wing, 2.60;
     tail, 2.60; culmen, .72; tarsus, .56.</p>

     class="sc">Char.</span></abbr> Size large (wing, 2.50); tail large, more
     than half the wing, the feathers very broad; usually a little
     rounded, sometimes slightly emarginated (as in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. mango</i>,
     <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. virginalis</i>, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. aurulentus</i>). Bill
     cylindrical, considerably curved, its vertical thickness least at
     about the middle. Nasal opercula nearly covered by the frontal
     feathers; tarsi naked. Wing very long, reaching to or beyond the
     tip of the tail; first primary longest, only slightly bowed, and
     not attenuated at tip; inner primaries normal.</p>

     <p class="footnote">The species of this genus belong chiefly to
     the West India Islands and to Tropical America,&mdash;principally
     on the Atlantic coast. They are all of more than the average
     size, and distinguished by broad tail-feathers, and rather dull,
     though handsome colors. In <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">L. porphyrurus</i> the sexes are
     alike in color. The following species has been accredited to
     North America, but probably upon erroneous data, since it belongs
     to northern South America, not even being an inhabitant of any of
     the West India Islands, except Trinidad. Still it is possible
     that, as alleged for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thaumatias linnæi</i> (see page 1064), it
     may have wandered far from its usual habitat, and have reached
     Florida, as stated by Mr. Audubon.</p>

     considering this bird as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus</i>, while there are
     many for referring it to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calypte</i>. The only feature that it
     shares with the former is the peculiar coloration, and to some
     extent the shape, of the tail. However, in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Selasphorus</i> the
     outer primary is always (in the male) attenuated and acute at the
     tip, and the crown is never metallic, while in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Calypte</i> the
     outer primary is never attenuated nor acute, and the crown of the
     male is always metallic. The form and coloration of the tail are
     nothing more than a specific character, since no two species, of
     either genus, agree in this respect. In view, then, of these
     considerations, we find <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">floresi</i> to be strictly congeneric

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
